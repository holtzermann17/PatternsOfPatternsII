% (1) Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?

% - Joe: Wanted to walk through the PoP paper with Rebecca, in order to help solidify my own grasp of the concepts and get her feedback.
% - Rebecca: This topic sounded interesting when you mentioned it and I wanted to learn about Pop

% (2) Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?

% - Indeed we did speed through the paper, Rebecca pointed out a few places where there was friction with the wording or concepts, like ``PEER-TO-PEER'' and also suggested Operational Research and Strategy as an appropriate topic; mentioned “improvisatory” style
% - Interruptions were welcomed!
% - Rebecca: was hesitant to interrupt the narrative
% - This is a bit different from usual IEAI style...

% (3) What are some different perspectives on what’s happening?

% - Joe: appreciate the time Rebecca has put into this a lot, and I also think this was a good way to present the paper
% - Rebecca: I think you assume knowledge in the presentation, and I think you need to assume the listener (if they aren’t in the area) that they don’t know anything.  It wouldn’t be patronising to explain the basic concepts.

% (4) What did we learn or change?

% - Talking to Karl, he would reconise one of the areas (probably) but not necessarily the other two.  Everyone is going to be new to some of these concepts.
% - This was great as a ``final edit'' — we will also be able to edit this paper until December
% - RR: is it your aim to automate?

% (5) What else should we change going forward?

% - Joe: if it would be helpful to RR, I’d certainly be happy to meet again about these ideas
% - Would this (patterns of patterns) to actually be useful for ethical AI?
% - E.g., rethink in the context of moral machines

\begin{abstract}
We review how our earlier theorization of pattern methods fares in the
wild.  The “wild” here included a graduate school classroom in New
York, a workshop at a transdisciplinary conference in Arizona, a
nascent citizen science project in Bristol, and a professional
development day for a university in Oxford.  We encountered unexpected
challenges such as working with students in a HyFlex classroom,
getting conference attendees to feel comfortable evaluating the
conference they were presently attending, and adapting our plans on
the fly when leading workshops with surprising attendee responses.  We
describe and refine patterns specifications that will help other
practitioners of patterns in their own forays into the wild.
