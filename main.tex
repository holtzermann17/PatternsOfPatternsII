\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:org195e8e3}
\label{Introduction}

%% ACTUAL START OF THE PAPER
%% {\color{red}
%% The previous installation in this series presented a high-level
%% methodological synthesis that aimed to get at the heart of what design
%% patterns are \cite{patterns-of-patterns-i}.  Here, we want to talk
%% about how we have implemented the methods described previously, and
%% give some reflections on where things are going next.  We will begin with a
%% recapitulation of the main points made in the earlier paper.  In
%% short, “Patterns of Patterns” encapsulated everything we had to say
%% about design patterns with \emph{one} overall pattern which operated
%% at a very high level.  Here, we elaborate many practical patterns
%% which expand on the same theme.  This fully-fledged collection of
%% patterns of patterns can help you organise your work with Design
%% Pattern Language methods.}

The previous installation in this series presented a high-level
methodological synthesis of three techniques from design, futures
studies, and learning management in the form of a design pattern
called PLACARD \cite{patterns-of-patterns-i}.  During the two years
which have elapsed since then, we have had opportunities to deploy and
further develop these methods in various contexts.  We will describe
some of these applications in the four case studies below.  We have
distilled this experience into a collection of practical patterns
which augment the earlier high-level pattern.  This fully-fledged
collection of patterns of patterns can help you organise your work
with Design Pattern Language methods.

% \textbf{Note: We can build out the structure based on this thesis, to follow through in later paragraphs.  These things are initially very different!  Maybe add a ref to the psych people about how difficult it is to combine them.  Let's talk some about the difficulties whether or not we have successfully negotiated them.}

% Towards realizing the promise of design patterns, we aim for an excavation and reworking of the theory.

\section{Background}
\subsection{Recap of “Patterns of Patterns”}
\label{sec:org7c32ecc}

We introduced a synthesis of methods that operationalise the
“sensory”, “cognitive” and “motor” systems from psychology in the context of social intelligence.  The particular methods we outlined were certainly not the only way to implement these system features.  What drew our attention is that each of the methods we selected comes with a framework or template; each of the methods is, essentially, a design pattern.

\begin{itemize}
\item Project Action Review (PAR): \emph{a set of five review questions to explore at a project checkpoint}.
\item Causal Layered Analysis (CLA): \emph{a set of four “layers” that can
be used to unpack a problem area of interest.}
\item Design Pattern Languages (DPL): \emph{each constituent pattern follows a “Context/Problem/Solution” template.}
\end{itemize}

We made the further assertion that these sensory, cognitive, and motor
methods can be hooked together, theorising design patterns as little
pieces of moveable social intelligence.  We called the specific method
that combines PAR, CLA, and DPL the “PLACARD” pattern.

We applied these methods to analyse the design Pattern Language
literature and practices, and also developed a case study examining
the way the Emacs Research Group used related methods.  We built on
these analyses to outline potential futures for the development of
pattern methods.
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item PLACARD becomes transferable and computational.
%% \item Pattern language authoring communities move to free/libre/open
%%   source licensing
%% \item Patterns empower individuals and communities
%% \item Patterns facilitate economic empowerment
%% \end{itemize}
%% All of these potential futures have early indicators attached to them,
%% in the sense of William Gibson: “the future is already here, it’s just
%% not very evenly distributed”.  But, now with reference to Alan Turing, much
%% remains to be done.

\subsection{Related work}
\citet{iba2016pattern} provide a large collection of patterns for
creating patterns.  Their threefold decomposition of the pattern
language creation process, into mining (\emph{a sensory activity}),
writing (\emph{a cognitive activity}), and symbolizing (\emph{a motor
activity}), bears an analogy with PLACARD.  However, here, aim is
neither to review such analogies, nor to evaluate the specific theory
encapsulated in Iba and Isaku’s {\scitshape Pattern Language Creation}
pattern.  Rather, what we aim to describe here in some detail is our
overall process of working with patterns.

Earlier authors, such as \citet{moran1971a} and \citet{OXMAN1994141},
looked at the specifically-computational implementation of design
pattern ideas.  Computational considerations remain mostly in the
background for us, as we focus on features of implementation at the
social interaction and paper prototype level.  We return to questions
related to supportive computational implementation in the closing
sections of this paper.

Regarding social cognition, we engage with the active inference
framework as a formalism which “can be applied to explain the
influential flows and dynamics of any open system at any scale,” per
\citet{Hiplito2022}.  These authors point out that patterns (in a
suitably general sense) are pre-linguistic, discovered and learned
through bodily experience.  With language, the articulation of
patterns allows us to participate in \emph{niche construction}.

In this regard, we work in a way that is rather closer to the
sensibilities of Christopher Alexander than those of Ren\'e
\citet{descartes1850discourse}, who wrote:
\begin{quote}
\ldots it is observable that the buildings which a single architect
has planned and executed, are generally more elegant and commodious
than those which several have attempted to improve, by making old
walls serve for purposes for which they were not originally built.
\end{quote}
We embrace the often messy process of prototyping our way forward; and
continue the reconstruction of pattern theory begun in the prequel.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:org134acbb}
\label{methods}

In the current paper we examine the major events in our work that took
place since the publication of “Patterns of Patterns”.  We ran three
formal workshops that were inspired by the original set of methods,
and we will describe \emph{how the methods evolved further in those
settings}.  We also used the aforementioned paper as a focal reading
over three sequential years of a postgraduate course, CIS 9590
“Information Systems Development Project” at Baruch College, part of
the City University of New York.  Together, an analysis of these
touchpoints suggests ways in which the methods can continue to evolve.
As before, we draw on the core methods of PLACARD, for example, using
Causal Layered Analysis directly within some of workshops, and also
using it as a \emph{post hoc} analysis tool.

Most centrally, we used design patterns both as design inputs and as
outputs in the workshops.  A selection of these patterns are included
here.  Each of the patterns is given a marker, (s), (c), or (m), to
indicate whether it plays a primarily sensory, cognitive, or motor
role.  We also include the \emph{itinerary} for each of the workshops
to help bring the reader into the scene, and encapsulate post-workshop
reflections as further design patterns.

In addition to making use of existing patterns, we made a point of
ensuring that those patterns had opportunity to grow and evolve, and
examine how their use fostered the emergence of additional patterns.
We endeavour to show this process within the paper.  As such, the
paper includes a combination of patterns that follow a formal
template, and proto-patterns with less structure.  Proto-patterns
without substructure distinguished by a “💎” marker, evoking the
concept of \emph{pattern mining}.  In our view, additional formality
does not always help with communication, and we endeavour to show how
and when it is helpful.  In Section \ref{cis-case-study}, we give some
examples which add pattern structure to proto-patterns.  Appendix
\ref{synthesis-of-form} gives some further justification for including
work at different levels of formality, with reference to
\citet{alexander1964notes}.

For the patterns which are spelled out formally, we typically use this
simple variation on the classical “Context Problem Solution” pattern
template:
\smallskip

\begin{tabular}{lll}
\phantom{hellohellohello}& \textbf{Context} \ldots & {[}Summary of the working context{]}\\
\phantom{hellohellohello}&\textbf{If} \ldots\ BUT \ldots & {[}A conflict, problem, or gap arising in this context{]}  \\
\phantom{hellohellohello}&\textbf{Then} \ldots & {[}Actions to take to resolve the conflict{]} \ldots
\end{tabular}
\smallskip

Some also include an \textbf{Example}.  We also use an intuitive
alternative pattern template structure to describe a sub-language of
roles.  Narrative around the patterns is presented in an italic font.



We present the patterns that we developed and used in (mostly)
chronological order, aiming to show how the use of certain patterns
help to give rise to the ``seeds'' of new patterns.  In this way of
working, the workshop method itself becomes a kind of (complex)
pattern, which we ran with variations.  At each stage, input patterns
play the role of lightweight hypotheses, structuring the experience
and potentially being validated or invalidated by the interactions.
As observed by \citet{iba2016pattern} a description of pattern-writing
patterns helped to identify when patterns are used, but \emph{not
every pattern is used every time}.  In our context, the survival of a
given pattern the next workshop (or not) gives a sense of the
evolutionary character of overall method.  Some of the methodological
changes were given strategic rationale, and became the seeds of new
patterns (e.g., {\sc Increase Participant Control}, elaborated in the
first case study below, is one such example).

On that note, we carefully reviewed the lessons learned after each
workshop, either by using the Project Action Review template, or
through less formal but nevertheless detailed post mortems.  Writing
this paper is an opportunity for review at a deeper rhythm.

\section{Case Study 1: “Going Meta” workshop at Anticipation 2022}

This workshop functioned as a more developed pilot of methods that we
already shared in earlier pilots (at PLoP 2021, at Oxford Brookes
Creative Industries Festival, and previously in more nascent forms).
Our aims were both to introduce the methods to attendees, and to
‘workshop’ the methods.  Our pitch was that we would help attendees to
establish a position of maximum leverage, exercising our “Critical
Anticipatory Capacities” using “Creativity, Innovation and New Media”
(two of the conference’s themes) to explore the future of
anticipation.

\subsection{Input patterns} \label{case1-inputs}

\emph{A small selection of patterns describing the workshop
activities, based on the more informal descriptions in our playbook,
were shared with workshop attendees in the form of “pattern cards”,
with which we transparently structured the workshop activities.  A
selection of these are shown in Figure \ref{cards}.  Several of these
are detailed below, along a few more-abstract patterns that
characterise the process.}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth,page=3,]{4-patternsa.pdf}
\caption{A selection of the pattern cards we handed out to participants of the “Going Meta” workshop\label{cards}}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{DÉRIVE COMIX{\hfill (s)}}

\textbf{Context} you want to develop some future scenarios to explore with a group.\newline
\textbf{If} you have an group BUT everyone has their own experiences;\newline
\textbf{Then} Gather data.  For example: go for a walk \cite{debord},  or just look out the window wherever you are.  (Alternatively, close your eyes and conduct a mental exploration of your selected theme: what do you see in “your mind’s eye?”) Document what you see.  Follow up by preparing your materials to share in a succinct fashion, e.g., as photos, a screenshot, slides, sketches, a zine, a map, or some PostIt\textsuperscript{\textregistered} notes.

\smallskip
\noindent \emph{By itself, looking to the immediate surroundings only
gives an imperfect picture of how to develop a future scenario.
Direct observations might include little to no evidence of, say,
top-level government policy which likely is a major factor in the
future.  Two further patterns access more levels of meaning.}

\subsection*{MEANING MAP {\hfill\cognitive}}

\textbf{Context} We have collected images describing people’s worlds
(see {\sc Dérive Comics}).\newline \textbf{If} you want to distill
shared meaning BUT everyone has their own experience;\newline
\textbf{Then} talk together about the problems and opportunities that
everyone sees.  Maybe some of these will cluster together, or maybe
everyone will have their own different perspective: that’s OK.  You
can use these different viewpoints to get everyone on the same
page.\newline\smallskip

\subsection*{REINFUSE EXPERTISE {\hfill \motor}}

\textbf{Context} a group wants to build a {\sc Meaning Map}.\newline
\textbf{If} everyone has experience as a citizen BUT they also have
expertise;\newline \textbf{Then} begin by removing expertise to get
everyone on the same page, and subsequently reinfuse expertise to
enable richer and more complex thinking.\newline\smallskip

\subsection*{PATTERN LANGUAGE COMPONENTS {\hfill \sensory}}

\textbf{Context} In a collaborative setting with people who are new to
design patterns.\newline \textbf{If} new attendees are being invited
to create new patterns BUT the context, problem, solution language
brings assumptions that they may not be comfortable \newline \textbf{Then}
introduce more dynamic keywords such as HOWEVER (to describe a gap or
conflict), BECAUSE (to describe a set of operating causes), THEREFORE
(to describe a rationale based on related data) , and SPECIFICALLY (to
describe next steps), to help people build patterns piece by piece.

\subsection*{FUNCTIONAL ROLES {\hfill \sensory}}

\textbf{Context} When building a new set of design patterns.\newline
\textbf{If} you have ideas about the components of a pattern BUT the
pattern hasn’t been fully formed yet.\newline \textbf{Then} introduce
different perspectives to critique the pattern as it
develops.

\smallskip

\noindent \emph{In this workshop, we tried aligning the {\sc Pattern
  Language Components} with {\sc Functional Roles}, as per “Phase II”
in the Workshop Itinerary which follows (Section
\ref{first-workshop-itinerary}).  In subsequent workshops, we decided
to separate these two dimensions more distinctly.  Further details on
roles are given in the next Case Study (Section
\ref{second-case-study}).}

\caption{In the workshop, participants used cards to structure discussions, and facilitators took notes and made diagrams.\label{anticipation-workshop}}
\end{figure}

Particpants had different responses to the structured interactions.
Some considered the workshop to have led to good conversations, but
doubted if the manipulatives and other structures helped.
Nevertheless, some participants did use the manipulatives in creative
ways, such as asking each other to pass around the cards describing
roles in order to better narrate the points they were making, and
joining in on note-taking when the facilitators got up to move around
the room.

\subsection{Output patterns}

\emph{The framing our workshop within the Anticipation conference suggested a pattern that could be repeated in other settings:}

\subsection*{GOING META{\hfill (c)}}\label{method1}
\label{sec:org958ff04}

\textbf{Context} In the course of working on a project
together.\newline \textbf{If} we find a \textit{gap} between our
ideals and our methods;\newline \textbf{Then} Try “going meta”, to
explore how the project’s methods can be applied to itself.\newline
\textbf{Example} In a community that usually focuses on anticipating
the future for others, try inviting members of the community to
anticipate the future of the community.

\medskip

\noindent \emph{Reflecting on the attendees’ contributions, both in
terms of their concrete comments about the Anticipation community as
well as the way they interacted within the workshop gave rise to the
following proto-pattern:}

\subsection*{💎 INCREASE PARTICIPANT CONTROL {\hfill \motor}}

When organising a collaborative activity, participants should not
remain only a audience, or only deliver scripted lines.  Give them
increasing responsibility.

\medskip

\noindent \emph{Looking back at some remove, we can also notice a
pattern that relates the work in this section to the paper:}

\subsection*{💎 PILOT TO ANTICIPATE {\hfill \sensory}}

Now invoking the {\sc Going Meta} pattern in the context of our work
on this paper, we reflect that our strategy of piloting our workshop
methods was the way we choose to anticipate the issues likely to arise
in future iterations of the workshop.

\newpage
\subsection{Diagrammatic Summary}\label{illustrative_diagram}
The following diagram shows how the new {\sc Going Meta} pattern was
synthesised together with three patterns that were present in the
workshop context, namely {\sc Dérive Comix}, {\sc Meaning Map}, and
{\sc Reinfuse Expertise}.  Some new patterns can be worked out in
advance of the workshop, however, following the PLACARD method, the
synthesis of new patterns typically makes use of the “open world” of
the workshop and its context.

\section{Case Study 2: Public Space for Public Health}\label{second-case-study}

This workshop was commissioned by Abby Tabor as part of her project
“Designing urban environments for human health: from the microbiome to
the metropolis”.  The aim was to gather attendees with an interest in
the project themes and work together to envision next
steps. Elaborations of these were developed by participants, and were
organised by facilitators using a software tool based on Org Roam and
Org Roam UI.
% \footnote{Demo: \url{https://hyperreal.enterprises/bristol}}

\subsection{Input patterns}

Alongside the main components of the initial workshop, we looked for
new methods to {\sc Increase Participant Control}.  In particular, we
generated some further articulations of the {\sc Functional Roles} to
help with this.

The patterns are presented here with a mnemonic symbol based on the
chess set; at the workshop, participants were provided with physical
manipulatives from a chess set that helped them get a grasp on the
roles, along with new pattern cards with the text on.

\subsection*{TIME TRAVELLER {\chess ♕} {\hfill \sensory}}

\textbf{Question} \emph{What has happened in the past, what could
happen in the future?}\newline
\textbf{Role} To provide historical context and
anticipate alternate futures.

\subsection*{WRINKLER {\chess ♘} {\hfill \motor}}

\textbf{Question} \emph{What could go wrong? }\newline
\textbf{Role.} Consider what might derail or counter
the proposed solution.  Each wrinkle can be assigned a level of
perturbation (from low to high).

%\textbf{Example} Everyday roadmap languages include both iconic map and road sign symbols; when people are confused or lost they may ask for help or try to find their own way back to the road using other informal languages.
\subsection*{ANALYST {\chess ♗♝} {\hfill \cognitive}}

\textbf{Question} \emph{What are the moving parts?}\newline
\textbf{Role 1} Consider the current challenge and all the components
of the potential solution (actors, resources, institutions). Identify
and orchestrate the dynamic network of these components.\newline
\textbf{Role 2} Consider the other challenges specified beyond the
current focus.  Identify and orchestrate the integration of these
components relevant to the present challenge.

\smallskip

\noindent \emph{(We also characterised some roles which would be
filled by offsite and onsite facilitators.)}

\subsection*{FACILITATOR ROLES {\hfill \cognitive}}
\textbf{Context} Developing a collection of interrelated design
patterns.\newline \textbf{If} you are getting ideas from participants
who play {\sc Functional Roles} BUT the ideas aren’t all connected
with each other in a structured way.\newline
\textbf{Then} introduce
facilitator roles to help structure the collection.\newline
\textbf{Specifically}, {\sc Linkers}, and {\sc Reflectors} are two
roles that we have found useful.

\emph{(The following patterns describe functions that were filled by
offsite and onsite facilitators.)}

\subsection*{LINKERS {\chess ♖}{\hfill \sensory}}

\textbf{Question}
\emph{How do proposed scenarios build into patterns across layers, and how do they interact within the constellation?}\newline
\textbf{Role.} Data wrangling as it comes in, providing visualisation of patterns and interconnections.

\subsection*{REFLECTORS {\chess ♔}{\hfill \cognitive}}

\textbf{Question} \emph{How is the scenario evolving?}\newline
\textbf{Role} To appraise each developing scenario, provide a format for reflection (e.g., PAR), make decision to continue, reset, end.

\subsection{Intermediate artefacts}

Intermediate artefacts generated within the workshop included mindmaps
created with participants, on paper.  We used a graphical template
following the outline of the Causal Layered Analysis layers to explain
the workshop’s overall workflow, and also asked participants to use a
version of this diagram as a “grid” for note-taking within Phase I, to
encourage them to work from their observations to the core underlying
themes and issues.  Participants then clarified these core themes in a
share-back process, and in Phase II, developed them further in the
form of shared future stories, outlining paths to action.  Photos in
Figure \ref{ExampleParticipantPattern} show the movement from:
\begin{itemize}
  \item initial sketching at the start of Phase I, beginning at the
    \emph{litany} level, within small groups (upper left), to:
  \item a collection of themes shared across groups at the end of
    Phase I, to create a {\sc Meaning Map} which, in CLA terms, is
    intended to bring everyone into a shared \emph{myth} layer (lower
    left), on to:
  \item Phase II work using {\sc Pattern Language Components},
    to identify both general and specific possibilities for action.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \emph{Reflecting on the contributions of the workshop
convenor and special guest, we observed a pattern that could be used
in subsequent workshops.}

\subsection*{CONTEXT SETTING {\hfill \cognitive}}
\textbf{Context} A workshop or other working context has been

\noindent \emph{Participants created several patterns by making use of
the {\sc Pattern Language Components} and {\sc Functional Roles}.
They presented below in  proto-pattern form.  These summaries
condense details which developed in the workshop using manipulatives
(cards and chess pieces), which afforded greater articulation, but,
perhaps, less coherence.}


\subsection*{💎 CONTESTED SPACE{\hfill \sensory}}\label{pat:contested-space}

So-called public space doesn’t always feel welcoming to all members of the public.  It can be overrun with antisocial behaviour.  It can feel exclusionary, or uninviting.  It can be the site of conflict.  Although the uses of public space are complex, each space need not to support every use equally.

\subsection*{💎 REBALANCE SOCIAL SERVICES{\hfill \motor}}\label{pat:rebalance-social-services}

Welfare-related services should be supplied in balance with local needs, though they often are not. Can varied expertise be integrated in a similar way to the domain-specific skills practised by Médicins Sans Frontièrs to address complex local challenges?

\subsection*{💎 FUNDING OF PUBLIC SPACE{\hfill \cognitive}}\label{pat:funding-of-public-space}

Even though public space is known to increase wellness in the population, well-being priorities that would lead to increased funding for public space aren’t universally adopted.  In order to make the benefits of such investment clear, increase transparency around investments in public welfare, e.g., create register of impacts of local social enterprises.

\medskip

\noindent \emph{The right-hand panel of Figure
\ref{ExampleParticipantPattern} shows how participants elaborated the
    {\sc Funding of Public Space} proto-pattern on the day, using the
    {\sc Pattern Language Components} that we provided as keywords on
    index cards; the others listed above were diagrammed out similarly
    on the day.)}

\medskip

\subsection{Remark on the Roles of Roles}
The three proto-patterns {\sc Contested Space}, {\sc Funding of Public
  Space}, and {\sc Rebalance Social Services} each were formed, in
part, through the influence of the {\sc Time Traveler}, {\sc Analyst}
and {\sc Wrinkler} roles.  Their contents have significant
differences, expressing the different compositions and interactions of
the workshop groups.

Relevant next steps could include revision and re-articulation of the
proto-patterns in more formal terms, and gathering evidence that would
support or refute the value of specific interventions.  The future
operations might be supported by new {\sc Functional Roles}, or by
further elaborations of those already described above, such as through
creating or combining roles.  Indeed, review (e.g., during a PAR) of
the contributions to the process that were made by different roles
could help to articulate the need and plan for evolution at the
process level.

Presently, with Table \ref{active-inference-factors} we draw attention
to the way in which the three main participant roles operationalise
key aspects of the Active Inference framework \cite{SMITH2022102632}.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
{\sc Time Traveller} & contributes to elaborating \emph{the prior
belief over states} and the \emph{likelihood of specific
observations}.\\

{\sc  Analyst} & contributes to elaborating the \emph{generative model}.\\

{\sc Wrinkler} & contributes to elaborating the \emph{factor of surprisal}.
\end{tabular}

\section{Case Study 3: Open Research Futures}

This workshop was developed as an “Away Day” for faculty and staff
members at Oxford Brookes University.  The aim of the workshop is to
elaborate the institution’s open research strategy relative to its
existing organisational strategy.  Methodologically, this workshop
builds on a pre-seeded Org Roam network of interlinked themes and an
additional activity that enlists attendees in taking concrete actions
on the identified next steps.  This itinerary reused the language
“experts to citizens”, “citizens to action” from the previous workshop
(with a slight variation suited to the context).  These phases mirrors
the {\sc Dérive Comix}—{\sc Meaning Map}—{\sc Reinfuse Expertise}
structure introduced earlier.

\subsection{Input Patterns}

\subsection*{DO YOUR RESEARCH{\hfill\sensory}}
\textbf{Context} Prior to beginning a formal workshop or other participatory research activity.\newline
\textbf{If} it looks like it will be possible to do participatory research BUT the participants haven’t begun speaking with each other yet.\newline \textbf{Then}
start doing the research in a more centralised way before inviting direct collaboration, in order to give participants something to engage with.\newline
\textbf{Example} In the current setting, this pre-research included 1-to-1 interviews with about half of the invitees, as well as internet research to find and explore related scenarios developed by others.\footnote{\url{https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/research-culture/changing-expectations/visions-of-2035/visions-of-2035-materials/}}

\subsection*{STRUCTURE CONVERSATIONS{\hfill\cognitive}}
\textbf{Context} Having convened a workshop or other participatory research activity.\newline
\textbf{If} unstructured discussions are likely to take lots of time but without yielding concrete benefits.\newline \textbf{Then}
structure the discussions around shared interests to move things forward more effectively.\newline
\textbf{Example} At this workshop, we decided to group participants around tables according to the faculty where they were employed (or most closely alignd, in the case of university-level support staff).

\subsection*{THE FUTURE BEGINS NOW{\hfill\motor}}
\textbf{Context} Having developed possible next steps.\newline
\textbf{If} appears that leaving without concrete commitments means
concrete actions are less likely to take place.\newline \textbf{Then}
introduce early actions within the
collaborative setting to create commitment.\newline
\textbf{Example} One way to build commitment would be to ask people to develop and share a method for a small-scale experiment that they plan to carry out.

some explicit (e.g., because of how the information was gathered,
cf. {\sc Structure Conversations}).  Additional structure can be
created, if you link intermediate artefacts into a relevant template.

\smallskip

\noindent \emph{In this setting, we used a template provided by the UK
Reproducibility Network for developing an Open Research Action Plan
(ORAP) \cite{orap-template} — itself, essentially, a complex pattern.
We linked the themes discussed in the workshop into this template, to
form a bullet-point draft of an action plan, incorporating the next
steps and concerns raised by attendees.  We did not specifically
include all of the background that appeared in our earlier interview
(cf. {\sc Do Your Research}).  Figure \ref{Org-Roam-Screenshot} shows
all of this material in an intermediate form, where we used Org Roam
to analyse the workshop themes (per the {\sc Linkers} pattern, above).
The process illustrated in this figure moves in the opposite direction
of \emph{Figures 3-7} of \citet{iba2016pattern}, insofar as they
complexify a tree as a graph, whereas we here move from an interlinked
graph of topics to a summary map in tree form.  This relates to the
interplay of informal and formal work, elaborated in Appendix
\ref{synthesis-of-form}.}

\section{Case Study 4: CIS 9590, Information Systems Development Project} \label{cis-case-study}

\subsection{Introduction the course from the instructor, Mary Tedeschi}
\input{mary-section}

\subsection{Our use of “Patterns of Patterns” within the course}
\label{pop1-in-cis9590}
We used the paper “Patterns of Patterns” as a focal text with three
successive cohorts of CIS 9590 students.  The course syllabus is
focused on developing group projects with a computer programming
component.  Our hope was that the topics in the paper would inspire
them with new ideas about design and collaboration.  We focus
primarily on the latest iteration of the course (Spring 2023), in
which we made the most explicit use of the methods described above.
Figure \ref{cis-9590-anticipations} shows some of our anticipations of
the relevant concerns that apply in this context.

Each year, students asked many thoughtful \emph{questions} about the
paper; they also produced their own \emph{written response} to the
paper, engaging the original paper in depth; and in the latest run, we
offered some in-class \emph{exercises} based on the workshop methods
described above.  Reading these written responses showed that the
students had not only understood the main ideas of our paper, but
added to them.  In effect, they created alternative imaginaries for
the paper’s history and future.  For instance, in their 2022 ‘case
study’, they generated a “Recommendation and Implementation Plan”
which proposed specific actions which a group could take based on our
ideas; and, in 2023, the students produced a slide presentation based
upon our paper, exploring its relationship to themes such as “emerging
technology”.  It is worth highlighting that while our paper did touch
briefly on the theme of emerging technology, the students considerably
elevated the importance of that theme in their feedback.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{tabular}{cc}
    \includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{UsCLA.png} &
    \includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{ThemCLA.png}
  \end{tabular}
\caption{Diagrams created before our first session with the CIS 9590 studens, inspired by Causal Layered Analysis.  The diagrams describe our working context as guests in CIS 9590 (left), and our initial understanding of the students’ working context (right).\label{cis-9590-anticipations}}
\end{figure}

Building in part on these student responses, we will now present our
reflections using the Causal Layered Analysis layers.  This is
scaffolded by the two diagrams in Figure \ref{cis-9590-anticipations}.

\subsubsection{Litany}
Initially our paper was introduced as a contemporary reading, relevant
to the “CIS” theme.  Mary chose a contemporary paper in part because
students would not be able to “cheat” in their reports, because our
paper wasn’t described extensively on Sparknotes or similar.  Along
with this (intentional) challenge, CIS 9590 students encountered a
range of more or less predictable problems, e.g., many felt a lack of
confidence with coding.  The students came to the course with a
variety of different backgrounds (e.g., Python vs C++) which
contributed to some friction with this course.

\subsubsection{System}
Whereas in our rounds of earlier participation we were more there for
enrichment, in the most recent iteration our contributions were more
closely integrated into the main activities of the course.  We
attended more sessions, including one in which we attempted to run a
short version of the workshop with attendees via Zoom.  Ongoing
interaction saw us in an ‘in residence’ role, advising on various
aspects of the projects.  Furthermore, Mary attended at least as many
meetings of the Peeragogy project (one of the centres of development
for PLACARD) as we attended sessions of the course, fostering an
exchange of ideas and viewponts between these two contexts. In the
short term, this led to productive synergy and, in the long term,
could lead to our pedagogical and peeragogical initiatives becoming
more integrated into a larger system. This collaboration continued
post-semester, insofar as Mary invited the students to express
interest in possible internships in the Peeragogy project.

\subsubsection{Worldview}
Students were thinking about their future careers.  What they wanted
to get out of the course (e.g., becoming a well-paid data scientist or
business leader) at times had some friction with the practical reality
of the course requirements, in which they had to deliver a concrete
hands-on working project, without being able to rely on employees.
PLACARD wouldn’t be of much direct help with the technical challenges
they faced with the Intel One platform, but we hoped it could help
them organise their work in a sensible way.  The ideas underlying
PLACARD informed our contributions to the course at various levels;
for example, in a session with Mary in which we ‘workshopped’ CIS 9590
with other peeragogues, discussants suggested adding more touchpoints
for peer learning and feedback (\emph{\`a la} the PAR).

\subsubsection{Myth}
A deep metaphor within the classroom setting is \emph{pedagogy}.
However, the methods that we brought as guests was more linked with
our experience of \emph{peeragogy}.  In the new shared context, these
two perspectives begin to integrate.  Mary as a host exercised the
value of \emph{xenia} by bringing us into her course as guests.  The
possibility of student internships within the Peeragogy project would
create the reciprocal opportunity for further student practice with
CIS skills in an applied context, helping to build tools and platforms
for peer learning and peer production (including through use of
pattern methods).  Indeed, the particular combination of peer learning
and formal education developed here led us to wonder how far off the
Peeragogy project might be from being able to support informal
learning of relevant programming concepts (preliminaries to CIS 9590)
or applied computing projects (an analogue of CIS 9590).  The
students’ emphasis on the theme of ‘emerging technology’ suggested
that whatever synthesis develops, it may include significantly
upgraded technical components.

\subsection{Proto-patterns describing the experience, by a CIS 9590 student, Manny Singh}\label{sec:manny-protopatterns}

%% Introduction:
%% During my final project class led by Professor Mary Tedeschi, the research paper 'Pattern of Patterns' and its authors played a pivotal role in shaping my project decisions. The authors' active engagement in our Zoom sessions provided invaluable insights into project layout, helped me avoid common mistakes, and encouraged a scalable and adaptable approach. Their active engagement and promises to come again in the following weeks to see progress on everyone’s individual project kept the butterflies, nervousness, and willingness to deliver all alive at the same time.

\emph{The following proto-patterns summarise one student’s reflection
on how our “active engagement and promises to come again in the
following weeks to see progress on everyone’s individual project kept
the butterflies, nervousness, and willingness to deliver all alive at
the same time.”  Further inline commentary expands and analyses the proto-patterns using {\sc Pattern Language Components}.}

\subsection*{💎 ENGAGEMENT AND GUIDANCE{\hfill \motor}}
The authors of ‘Pattern of Patterns‘ actively participated in our
class, to share expertise and create a collaborative learning
environment. Their presence allowed us to gain deeper insights into
the paper's concepts and methodologies, leading to innovative project
approaches. By closely studying the patterns of patterns identified in
their research, I gained a fresh perspective on project organization
and established a logical and coherent structure.

\smallskip
\noindent\emph{Notice that within this capsule summary there are at least two implied conflicts:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Team work is required HOWEVER the ways to scaffold effective collaboration are not entirely obvious;}
\item \emph{Project development is required HOWEVER project structure is not obvious.}
\end{itemize}
\emph{Our interactions with both the teacher and the students helped us theorise the confusion:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{These difficulties exist BECAUSE participants do not have enough experience grappling with ‘worked examples’ (both learning best practices from successful examples, and learning by giving constructive feedback on less-successful examples).} 
\end{itemize}
\emph{“Patterns of Patterns” provides some generic methods that can be applied to the domain-level problems.  Moreover, contact with the authors shifted the game, relative to simply reading the preprint.}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{THEREFORE, share some easy-to-understand general-purpose method with novices, and put them in regular contact with people who have significant experience with problems in the domains of project management and collaboration.} 
\end{itemize}
\emph{Thinking beyond the Spring 2023 CIS 9590 cohort to next steps, we need better ways to share this kind of experience:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{SPECIFICALLY, can the Peeragogy project develop an internship/mentoring programme?  Respectively, can more touchpoints for mentoring and peer feedback be built into the CIS 9590 curriculum?} 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{💎 AVOIDING MISTAKES{\hfill \cognitive}}
The authors' insights helped me navigate common project development
pitfalls.  Through their emphasis on effective documentation, regular
testing, and thorough project planning, I was able to avoid costly
errors.  Their guidance ensured a consistent progress trajectory and
maintained the professionalism of my final project.

\smallskip
\noindent \emph{The nice features of “effective documentation, regular testing, and thorough project planning” might be interpreted in terms of PLACARD components:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{A project needs to be carried out HOWEVER it’s not clear what to do to make the project a success}
  \item \emph{BECAUSE projects have fairly well-known failure modes}
  \item \emph{THEREFORE teach and carry out ways to avert those
  failures: e.g., use Project Action Reviews to keep track of
  incremental steps in the development of the project; use Design
  Pattern Languages to design, build and evaluate prototypes; and use
  Causal Layered Analysis to integrate data from these to build an
  adaptable project plan that addresses a real problem.}
\end{itemize}
\emph{(That said, it would be helpful to offer more specific guidance, relevant to the novices’ working context.)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{SPECIFICALLY, use a resource like
\citet{hoover2009apprenticeship} to flesh out this advice for future
CIS 9590 cohorts, and ask them to document the patterns they use.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{💎 SCALING AND ADAPTABILITY{\hfill \cognitive}}
‘Pattern of Patterns’ underscored the importance of scalability and
adaptability in project design.  By considering future technologies
and incorporating modular elements, I aim to seamlessly adopt new
advancements.  In particular, I focused on building a flexible
framework that could easily accommodate emerging technologies.

\smallskip
\noindent \emph{In the language we’ve been using internally,
“scalability and adaptability” sounds a lot like ‘working across
contexts’.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{We want a system that will adapt to situations we haven’t encountered yet HOWEVER we need something reasonably specific and concrete in order to work in any given context}
  \item \emph{BECAUSE we need to organise evolving complexity} 
  \item \emph{THEREFORE develop a modular approach to design and development, and incorporate future scanning into the workflow}
  \item \emph{SPECIFICALLY let’s look for more ways to develop ‘alternative imaginaries’ for the Patterns of Patterns project}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Further reflections and next steps}\label{further-reflections}

Our anticipations (summarised in Figure \ref{cis-9590-anticipations})
didn’t precisely match our reflections at the end of the course.  The
missing steps on the way to the eventual synthesis could suggest
further patterns, including elaborations on Manny Singh’s
proto-patterns that would give them more specificity, and influence
our participation in future cohorts.  We observe that when
\emph{working across contexts}, many of the ‘forces’ at work in a
given context are initially hidden to us.  For example, we didn’t
anticipate the students’ hesitance around coding, nor did we anticpate
their taking up the cause for emerging technologies around PLACARD
methods.

The analysis in Section \ref{pop1-in-cis9590}, paired with the
proto-patterns in Section \ref{sec:manny-protopatterns}, develops the
\emph{litany-to-myth-back-to-litany} outline typical of other
workshops.  Like the first case study, we used the experience to
workshop our methods, here resulting in specific directions to explore
in our ongoing and future work.

For example, in Figure \ref{sridevi-course}, we used a visual CLA
template like the ones in Figure \ref{cis-9590-anticipations} to help
design a new introduction to computing course for high school
students.  Here, part the \emph{system} layer envisions ‘multiple
circles’ (i.e., multiple instantiatens of this same template) which
would express the developing perspective of different groups of
students, to be integrated though a ‘monitoring’ interface used by the
instructor.  This is a good expression of how working across contexts
could work in practice.

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{sridevi-course.png}
\caption{We used the CLA template to plan a future Introduction to Computing course for high school students\label{sridevi-course}}
\end{figure}



%% Conclusion:
%% The research paper 'Pattern of Patterns' and its authors significantly influenced my final project experience. Their engagement, guidance in project layout, avoidance of common mistakes, and focus on scalability and adaptability empowered me to make informed decisions. By observing patterns and applying their insights, I successfully developed a project that thrived in the dynamic landscape of technology. I am grateful for the authors' contributions, which shaped my final project journey under Professor Mary Tedeschi's guidance.

\section{Discussion}

We presented the patterns that we developed and used over successive
runns of our workshop, in approximately chronological order.  This
showed how the use of certain patterns help to give rise to the
``seeds'' of new patterns.  The evolving workshop method is a pattern
language which operationalises the PLACARD pattern.

The first workshop mixed {\sc Pattern Language Components} with {\sc
  Functional Roles}, putting participants in the thick of a
pattern-related dialogue.  While this led to interesting
conversations, it was more work to extract any patterns.  However, we
did find some useful process patterns this way, such as {\sc Increase
  Participant Control}.  We employed what we learned in subsequent
runs.  In the second workshop, a more distinct use of the {\sc Pattern
  Language Components} helped the participants come up with their own
patterns.

There is an interesting interplay between content-level patterns like
these, and process-level patterns.  For instance, the workshop is akin
to a public space; further development of the associated tools might
make it even more of a public resource — somewhat like Wikipedia, but endorsing the contribution of original research, not forbidding it.  Already, the workshop is a context in which to do a kind of rapid, local, open research.

In order for any pattern-informed research to work well, we should be gathering evidence for or against the salience of the patterns that are elaborated.  The Octopus\footnote{\url{https://www.octopus.ac/}} platform mentioned in the itinerary for Case Study 3 uses several data types that follow the rough outline of a scientific paper, \emph{viz.},
Research Problem,
Rationale/Hypothesis,
Method,
Results,
Analysis,
Interpretation,
Real World Application, and
Peer Review.
The formulation of an Octopus-like platform for recording and reporting on design patterns would probably need to change somewhat — but the \textbf{Problem}, \textbf{Rationale}, \textbf{Method}, and \textbf{Results} components are reasonably familiar for pattern authors.

Table \ref{summary} summarises the patterns that were described in
this paper, pulling them together from across the separate case
studies.  The table shows the patterns grouped in a way that
elaborates our use of “PAR”, “CLA”, and “DPL” methods (summarised in
Section \ref{sec:org7c32ecc}) with a more rounded description of the
purposes that these methods serve.  Figure \ref{pattern-analysis}
summarises the patterns in a more visual way.

\section{Conclusion}

We hoped that running these workshops would help us design the next
steps for our platform and process, and this seems to have been
successful.  As an immediate outcome, we developed the “PLACARD
workshop” — now retitled “Open Future Design” — across several
successive runs in different organisational contexts in a way that
makes it more robust.  This relative success notwithstanding, it is
worth recalling that our initial intention in “Patterns of Patterns”
was to support distributed collaboration across contexts.

The informal pattern-based review of our evolving work, presented
here, is a good start, if only a partial implementation of the vision.
Running the Open Future Design workshop in different settings and
writing up our findings here implements the {\sc Do Your Research}
pattern.  Nevertheless, although wide-ranging and participatory, the
development of this research remains mostly centralised.  We have not
yet implemented a fully distributed peer-to-peer collaboration
platform, however, we have created something like a client-server
simulation of one.

A crucial insight is that the meta-level is just another domain.  All
models that aim to be practical — whether patterns of public health,
open research, climate action, or patterns of patterns — should
include predictions about the causal connections between actions and
measurements, and should incorporate strategic intelligence to
articulate action.

Again, here, we have made a start.  In particular, this research
scaffolds an alternative Causal Layered Analysis of pattern language
methods to the one developed in the previous “Patterns of Patterns”
paper.  (The visual summary in Figure \ref{pattern-analysis} is
elaborated in Appendix \ref{cla-appendix}.)  More work would be needed
to fully describe our patterns’ application domains, to build evidence
of the kinds of results that can be expected, and to describe their
interconnections as a pattern language.

That work would usefully have a software aspect.  For example, a
not-so-distant future for Org Roam would allow several facilitators to
make notes in near real-time into a shared map, and with some more
fine tuning of the Emacs interface, a similar workflow could be used
directly by workshop attendees, even across different contexts.  Many
rich dialogues might ensue: already we have seen the potential for
fruitful cross-disciplinary interaction between people from fields as
disparate as future studies, health sciences, open research, and
information systems.

Org Roam could be augmented with additional “emerging technologies”.
Support for the articulation of domain-level patterns which outline
potential new behaviours, and for the process of gathering evidence
that those behaviours do (or do not) in fact work as intended is
already an ambitious but logical ramification of the pattern method.

It is a further step to articulate the learning apparatus that
underpins such mechanisms in a computationally-coherent way.  The {\sc
  Functional Roles} provide an early informal articulation of the
process.  We have made reference to the Active Inference Framework as
a foundational theory that could scaffold further more formal
developments along these lines.



In a Pattern Languages of Programs spirit, it would be interesting to
‘close the loop’ with an articulation of programming-specific design
considerations, as described, e.g., by \citet{felleisen2018design}.
Thinking beyond traditional programming, AI methods could be employed
alongside to elaborate and work with DPL models — to identify
analogies between action arenas, to highlight the ramifications of
complex actions, to show predicted costs and benefits, to search for
tipping points that allow the effects of change to reach across level
boundaries, and as well as to surface new questions.

We have begun (as we mean to carry on) by focusing on the development
and articulation of multi-purpose tools for thought.

\section{Relationship to Alexander’s “Synthesis of Form”\label{synthesis-of-form}}
In this paper and the previous paper on “Patterns of Patterns” we have
considered the problems faced by groups of people organizing their
activities.  This can be usefully related to two diagrams from
Alexander's ``Notes on the Synthesis of Form'', recopied below as
Figure \ref{synthesis-diagrams}.  Parts a.-c. of this figure have two
columns corresponding to context/form (or problem/solution), and one,
two, or three rows, corresponding to the ``actual world'', ``mental
picture'' and ``formal picture''.  A design problem is posed at the
level of the actual world, say, ``build a house atop this hill'' or
``make a celebration song''.

The design problem can be solved at one of the three levels.  The most
direct approach is to work in the actual world.  For instance, a
musician might pick up an instrument, start playing something, try out
different possibilities, modify notes or phrasings to make it sound
better, and so come up with a song.

At the level of ``mental picture'', a designer receives design
requirements which describe the problem, and produces a plan which
describes a solution.  For instance, the host of the party might make
a request ``Write a joyous song for alto voice accompanied by flute,
trumpet, and saxophone to celebrate the acceptance of our paper into
the conference.''  A composer might then sit down at a desk, away from
any instruments, and write out a score which would later be handed to
the singer and instrumentalists for performance.  Alexander points out
that there is a danger in this process: the composer would no longer
have the immediate feedback which comes from working directly in the
actual world.  Accordingly, the result might be a song that matches
the description, but doesn’t match the mood of the event.

Alexander’s proposed solution is to produce a formal picture of the
mental picture, and instead work with that formal picture.  For our
example, it might take the form of a suitably elaborate music theory,
one that includes concepts like ‘\emph{ballabile}’ (which indicates
that the song should be danceable).  More generally, we employ a
suitable metalanguage to reason about the mental representation; this
process of reasoning can then take the place of feedback from the
actual world in guiding and evaluating our designs.  For Alexander,
this consists of a set-theoretic formalization of design requirements
and potential misfits.

%% In the PLACARD setting, (CLA’s layers might correspond,
%% metaphorically, to the different voices used in the composition; a
%% analysis process akin to CLA might help to address goodness-of-fit.

Figure \ref{synthesis-diagrams}d refers to the process of design once
we have arrived at the ``formal picture'' level.  The left panel
represents the analytic process in which one decomposes a design
problem into subproblems and the right panel represents the
complementary synthetic process in which one successively combines
solutions to subproblems to arrive at a solution to the original
problem.  Alexander proposed a maximum entropy method for carrying out
the analysis and, in later works, introduced design patterns for use
in the synthesis; and ultimately, described 15 principles that could
guide a design at an even more abstract level.

The naive ``actual world'' approach (Figure \ref{synthesis-diagrams}a)
would be when a group takes a ``seat of the pants'' approach to
dealing with issues as they come up in the course of work.  PAR can
help to sketch a ``mental picture''.  CLA and DPL can be used as
techniques for analysis and synthesis at the ``formal picture'' level.
 Just as even a talented
musician without a solid grasp of music theory would be hard pressed
to compose an augmentation canon or symphony, so too we suggest that a
group which faces complex challenges may want to consider these
techniques for orchestrating their activities.  In sum, the methods
we’ve discussed can be used to operationalise a strategy that is at
the heart of Christopher Alexander’s oeuvre.

\section{SUPPLEMENT: Analysis: CLA applied to “Patterns of Patterns”} \label{cla-appendix}
\subsection{Litany: Understanding data, headlines, empirical world (short term change)}
Our Open Future Design workshop has evolved certain key features which
have been retained across different implementations.  Participants can
expect a certain amount of {\sc Context Setting}, as well as an
introduction to {\sc Pattern Language Components}, and {\sc Functional
  Roles}.  The outputs are created collaboratively, with some emphasis
on {\sc Facilitator Roles}.  One outstanding problem is how the
process of facilitation can be distributed out to participants.
Already these ingredients have allowed us to organize a (small-scale)
pattern-based research programme, addressing one of the problems that
we saw in our earlier CLA of the DPL literature.

We have seen that Open Future Design can help people articulate and
grapple with issues they see in their lives and communities, for
example {\sc Funding of Public Space}, {\sc Contested Space} and the
need to {\sc Rebalance Social Services}.  This list is representative
rather than exhaustive.

\subsection{System: Systemic approaches and solutions (social system)}
The workshop proceeds through a combination of process steps ({\sc
  D\'erive Comix}, {\sc Meaning Map}, {\sc Reinfuse Expertise}),
supported by facilitator who work either behind the scenes to {\sc Do
  Your Research} or more overtly to {\sc Structure Conversations} and
{\sc Structure Outputs}.  Facilitators take on the roles of {\sc
  Linkers} and {\sc Reflectors}, while participants are invited to
take on the roles of {\sc Analyst}, {\sc Time Traveller}, and {\sc
  Wrinkler}.  The methods we have used have a tendancy to {\sc
  Increase Participant Control}.  This could be pushed further, e.g.,
with earlier phases that involve workshop participants in co-designing
the workshop experience itself, and in subsequent phases which gather
and analyse data.  The current articulation of patterns offers a
considerable amount of material that be folded into such developments.

\subsection{Worldview: ways of knowing and alternative discourse}
The perspective, articulated by one workshop user and endorsed by our
authoring collective, is that these methods help to communicate a
worldview which endorses {\sc Scaling and Adaptability}, which offers
{\sc Engagement and Guidance}, and which helps with {\sc Avoiding
  Mistakes}.  The Open Future Design workshop goes along with the view
that {\sc The Future Begins Now}, insofar as the actions which are
considered inside the workshop are things that are worth testing and
developing.  For this purpose a primary method used is {\sc Pilot to
  Anticipate}.  Taken together, these perspectives are linked with the
ethos of Peeragogy or “peer produced peer learning”.

\subsection{Myths: metaphors and narratives (longer term change)}
We have flagged {\sc Going Meta} as the primary metaphor of this work,
very much in line with the series title, “Patterns of Patterns”.

\section{Shepherd comments and response 1 Jul 2023, 05:43}

\begin{leftbubbles}
\label{Q:developed-by-authors} Section4: Question regarding pattern contents: In section 3, it is mentioned that "We used design patterns directly when developing and running the workshops. A selection of these patterns are included here." Are the patterns presented in section 4 the same design patterns developed by the authors, or are they created by someone else?
\end{leftbubbles}
\begin{rightbubbles}
Most of the patterns in the Case Studies were developed by the
authors, a few were developed by workshop participants during the
workshop and only summarised here ({\sc
  \hyperref[pat:contested-space]{Contested Space}}, {\sc
  \hyperref[pat:funding-of-public-space]{Funding of Public Space}},
{\sc \hyperref[{pat:rebalance-social-services}]{Rebalance Social
    Services}}).  Regarding contributions from Manvinder Singh: he was
originally a ‘participant’, and then became an author.
\end{rightbubbles}

\begin{leftbubbles}
Additionally, the format of the "Selected Patterns for Case Study" in
section 4 varies (e.g., some have only summaries or start with
questions), which raises concerns. If these patterns were developed by
the authors, it should write patterns in a consistent format with
context, problem, and solution. Furthermore, it is necessary to
include the Forces that explain the causes of the problem and the
Consequences as potential results of implementing the solution.
\end{leftbubbles}

\begin{rightbubbles}
Personally, I (Joe) don’t fully agree with the suggestion to use
‘consistent format’ throughout the document.  The patterns are
presented at different levels of formality corresponding to their
stage of development.  Personally I don’t see forces, consequences,
and potential results as entirely necessary, though they might be nice
to have.  In particular, if the patterns aren’t understable in their
current format, they certainly need to be revised.  Let’s see if the
clarifications we’ve developed so far are enough.

What we’ve come up with, after consultation with the coauthors, is a
better explanation of what we aim to do with the patterns here (in the
Methodology section) and a lot more pictures that aim to illustrate
the points that are being made.  Hopefully this achieves most of the
additional clarity that was intended by the shepherd suggestion above.

(One more quick point about forces: we talk briefly about how a force
analysis is complicated by working across contexts in Section
\ref{further-reflections}.)
\end{rightbubbles}

\begin{leftbubbles}
Regarding the structure: In the current paper, each subsection of
section 4 presents the Itinerary first, then presents the “Selected
Patterns for Case Study.” However, since the patterns are embedded
within the Itinerary without being presented beforehand, it becomes
unclear. It leads to confusion, such as in the case of
4.1.2. Considering the flow from the METHODOLOGY in section 3, it
might be more reader-friendly and coherent to present 4.1.1 as
"Selected Patterns for Case Study" and 4.1.2 as Itinerary. This way,
readers can follow along with the discovery of how the patterns shape
the itinerary. Additionally, assigning pattern numbers to each pattern
and including the number in parentheses after the pattern mentioned in
the itinerary would make it more comprehensible for readers. For
example, something like "Meaning Map (No.3) in the content of
Itinerary."
\end{leftbubbles}

\begin{rightbubbles}
I’ve restructured each subsection ‘in order’ with clearly delineated
inputs, process, and outputs.  {\huge ✔️}
\end{rightbubbles}

\begin{leftbubbles}
4.1: Regarding DÉRIVE COMIX: The solution "Go for a walk or just look
out the window wherever you are, and document what you see” is
important for solving the problem. However, in the Itinerary, it is
mentioned to "Bring data: captioned mental images of “anticipation in
action” (feel free to refer to photos on your phone)," which does not
align with the solution of the pattern.
\end{leftbubbles}

\begin{rightbubbles}
Slightly reworded to make these align better. {\huge ✔️}
\end{rightbubbles}

\begin{leftbubbles}
4.5: The subsection name of "Proto-patterns describing the experience,
by a CIS 9590 student, Manvinder Singh” seems to be unrelated to the
"CASE STUDIES” which is the name of section 4. It might be better to
present this as a separate section. Furthermore, the content written
here appears to be a summary of what was learned from the case studies
rather than patterns. If it is intended to be patterns, it is
necessary to include the context, problem, and solution.
\end{leftbubbles}

\begin{rightbubbles}
The \LaTeX\ section level was incorrect, which was the main source of
confusion here.  These are “outputs” from Case Study 4 — not
reflections on all of the case studies.  That’s fixed now.  {\huge ✔️}

(As for how formal we need to be about presenting them, see my comment
above for now.)
\end{rightbubbles}

\begin{leftbubbles}
Examples: AVOIDING MISTAKES, it is necessary to describe the effective
solutions and the potential problems that may arise if those solutions
are not implemented.
\end{leftbubbles}

\begin{rightbubbles}
I’ve presented the material in both proto-pattern form and expanded
using pattern language components; I think that’s the right level of
detail for now. {\huge ✔️}
\end{rightbubbles}
\end{document}
