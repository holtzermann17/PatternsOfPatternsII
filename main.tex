\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:org195e8e3}
\label{Introduction}

%% ACTUAL START OF THE PAPER
%% {\color{red}
%% The previous installation in this series presented a high-level
%% methodological synthesis that aimed to get at the heart of what design
%% patterns are \cite{patterns-of-patterns-i}.  Here, we want to talk
%% about how we have implemented the methods described previously, and
%% give some reflections on where things are going next.  We will begin with a
%% recapitulation of the main points made in the earlier paper.  In
%% short, “Patterns of Patterns” encapsulated everything we had to say
%% about design patterns with \emph{one} overall pattern which operated
%% at a very high level.  Here, we elaborate many practical patterns
%% which expand on the same theme.  This fully-fledged collection of
%% patterns of patterns can help you organise your work with Design
%% Pattern Language methods.}

Our paper “Patterns of Patterns” presented a high-level methodological
synthesis of three techniques from design, futures studies, and
learning management in the form of a design pattern called PLACARD
\cite{patterns-of-patterns-i}.  Since then, we have had opportunities
to deploy and further develop these methods in various contexts.  We
will describe some of these applications in the four case studies
below.  We have distilled this experience into a collection of
practical patterns which augment the earlier high-level PLACARD
pattern.  This fully-fledged collection of patterns of patterns can
help you organize your work with Design Pattern Language methods.

% \textbf{Note: We can build out the structure based on this thesis, to follow through in later paragraphs.  These things are initially very different!  Maybe add a ref to the psych people about how difficult it is to combine them.  Let's talk some about the difficulties whether or not we have successfully negotiated them.}

% Towards realizing the promise of design patterns, we aim for an excavation and reworking of the theory.

\section{Background}
\subsection{Recap of “Patterns of Patterns”}
\label{sec:org7c32ecc}

We introduced a synthesis of methods that operationalize the
“sensory”, “cognitive” and “motor” systems from psychology in the context of social intelligence.  The particular methods we outlined were certainly not the only way to implement these system features.  What drew our attention is that each of the methods we selected comes with a framework or template; each of the methods is, essentially, a design pattern.

\begin{itemize}
\item Project Action Review (PAR): \emph{a set of five review questions to explore at a project checkpoint}.
\item Causal Layered Analysis (CLA): \emph{a set of four “layers” that can
be used to unpack a problem area of interest.}
\item Design Pattern Languages (DPL): \emph{each constituent pattern follows a “Context/Problem/Solution” template.}
\end{itemize}

We made the further assertion that these sensory, cognitive, and motor
methods can be hooked together, theorizing design patterns as little
pieces of moveable social intelligence.  We called the specific method
that combines PAR, CLA, and DPL the “PLACARD” pattern.

We applied these methods to analyze the design Pattern Language
literature and practices, and also developed a case study examining
the way the Emacs Research Group used related methods.  We built on
these analyzes to outline potential futures for the development of
pattern methods.
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item PLACARD becomes transferable and computational.
%% \item Pattern language authoring communities move to free/libre/open
%%   source licensing
%% \item Patterns empower individuals and communities
%% \item Patterns facilitate economic empowerment
%% \end{itemize}
%% All of these potential futures have early indicators attached to them,
%% in the sense of William Gibson: “the future is already here, it’s just
%% not very evenly distributed”.  But, now with reference to Alan Turing, much
%% remains to be done.

\subsection{Related work}
Our work progressed within and alongside the Peeragogy project:
aspects of peeragogy were previously presented as design patterns
\cite{corneli2015a}.  Our aim in the workshops, described here, was to
share some of the way we work together, rapidly scaffolding
collaboration processes among people who typically have never worked
together before.  Of course, there are many ways to build
collaboration and to develop effective projects; for example,
\emph{sociocracy} \cite{sociocracy-manual} is a strategy for
collaboration which is distributed over nested ‘circles’, and
\emph{theory of change} \cite{Coryn2010} describes how to articulate
criteria for a project’s success by mapping the preconditions for
change.  \emph{Agile methods} are perhaps better known to authors
working with design patterns, since they share a similar etiology and
have been fruitfully combined \cite{sutherland2019a}.  Compared with
these other methods, peeragogy is distinctively informal, in the sense
that it can be used anywhere: within, outside, or across organizations
and projects.

\citet{iba2016pattern} provide a large collection of patterns for
creating patterns.  Their threefold decomposition of the pattern
language creation process, into mining (\emph{a sensory activity}),
writing (\emph{a cognitive activity}), and symbolizing (\emph{a motor
activity}), bears an analogy with PLACARD.  Our aim is not to retrace
Iba and Isaku’s {\scitshape Pattern Language Creation} pattern —
though we do cross-reference their work at key junctures here.
Rather, our aim is to descibe our own process of working with
patterns, and to continue the reconstruction of pattern theory begun
in the prequel.

Earlier authors, such as \citet{moran1971a} and \citet{OXMAN1994141},
looked at the specifically-computational implementation of design
pattern ideas.  Computational considerations remain mostly in the
background for us, as we focus on features of implementation at the
social interaction and paper prototype level.  We return to questions
related to supportive computational implementation in the closing
sections of this paper.

In Section \ref{second-case-study}, we draw connections between our
work here to the active inference framework, which “can be applied to
explain the influential flows and dynamics of any open system at any
scale” \cite{Hiplito2022}, and begin to integrate this framework with
pattern language methods.  Hip\'olito and van Es point out that
patterns (when understood in a suitably general sense) are
pre-linguistic, and are discovered and learned through bodily
experience.  With language, the articulation of patterns allows us to
participate in a process \emph{niche construction}.
%% Can we relate Alexander’s “Maximum Entropy” analysis with the stats methods used here?
%% Add City is not a tree quote.
%% In this regard, we work in a way that is rather closer to the
%% sensibilities of Christopher \citet{alexander1965a} —
%% \begin{quote}
%% It is more and more widely recognized today that there is some
%% essential ingredient missing from artificial cities. When compared
%% with ancient cities that have acquired the patina of life, our modern
%% attempts to create cities artificially are, from a human point of
%% view, entirely unsuccessful.
%% \end{quote}
%% — than those of Ren\'e
%% \citet{descartes1850discourse}, who wrote:
%% \begin{quote}
%% \ldots it is observable that the buildings which a single architect
%% has planned and executed, are generally more elegant and commodious
%% than those which several have attempted to improve, by making old
%% walls serve for purposes for which they were not originally built.
%% \end{quote}
Towards this end, we embrace the often messy process of prototyping
our way forward.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:org134acbb}
\label{methods}

We focus on a few landmarks in our collaboration that have taken shape
since the publication of “Patterns of Patterns”.  We ran three
separate workshops that were inspired by the original set of methods,
and we will describe how the methods evolved further in those
settings.  We also used the aforementioned paper as a focal reading
over three sequential years of a postgraduate course, CIS 9590
“Information Systems Development Project” at Baruch College, part of
the City University of New York.  We use experience reports and Causal
Layered Analysis to develop a deep dive into that application.

We used design patterns both as design inputs and as outputs in each
of the workshops.  A selection of these patterns are included here.
Each of the patterns is given a marker, (s), (c), or (m), to indicate
whether it plays a primarily sensory, cognitive, or motor role.  We
also include the \emph{itinerary} for each of the workshops to help
bring the reader into the scene, and encapsulate post-workshop
reflections as further design patterns.

In addition to making use of existing patterns, we made a point of
ensuring that those patterns had opportunity to grow and evolve, and
examine how their use fostered the emergence of additional patterns.
We endeavor to show this process within the paper.  As such, the
paper includes a combination of patterns that follow a formal
template, and proto-patterns with less structure.  Proto-patterns
without substructure are distinguished by a “💎” marker, evoking the
concept of \emph{pattern mining}.  In our view, additional formality
does not always help with communication, and we endeavor to show how
and when it is helpful.  In Section \ref{cis-case-study}, we give some
examples which use our {\sc Pattern Language Components} to add
structure to proto-patterns.  Appendix \ref{synthesis-of-form} gives
some further justification for including work at different levels of
formality, with reference to \citet{alexander1964notes}.  Some of the
(proto-)patterns that we present here were created by workshop
participants rather than by coauthors, and these are distinguished by
a “⚒” marker (regardless of their level of formality).

For the patterns which are spelled out formally in the paper, we
typically use this simple variation on the classical “Context Problem
Solution” pattern template:
\smallskip

\begin{tabular}{lll}
\phantom{hellohellohello}& \textbf{Context} \ldots & {[}Summary of the working context{]}\\
\phantom{hellohellohello}&\textbf{If} \ldots\ BUT \ldots & {[}A conflict, problem, or gap arising in this context{]}  \\
\phantom{hellohellohello}&\textbf{Then} \ldots & {[}Actions to take to resolve the conflict{]}
\end{tabular}
\smallskip

We use an intuitive alternative template structure to describe a
sub-language of roles in Section \ref{second-case-study}.  In the
sections focused on presenting patterns, narrative around the patterns
appears in an italic font.

We present the patterns that we developed and used in (mostly)
chronological order, aiming to show how the use of certain patterns
help to give rise to the ``seeds'' of new patterns.  In this way of
working, the workshop method itself becomes a kind of (complex)
pattern, which we ran with variations.  At each stage, input patterns
play the role of lightweight hypotheses, structuring the experience
and potentially being validated or invalidated by the interactions.
As observed by \citet{iba2016pattern} a description of pattern-writing
patterns helped to identify when patterns are used, but \emph{not
every pattern is used every time}.  In our context, the survival of a
given pattern to the next workshop (or not) gives a sense of the
evolutionary character of the overall method.  Some of the methodological
changes were given strategic rationale, and became the seeds of new
patterns (e.g., {\sc Increase Participant Control}, elaborated in the
first case study below, is one such example).

On that note, we carefully reviewed the lessons learned after each
workshop, either by using the Project Action Review template, or
through less formal but nevertheless detailed post mortems.  Writing
this paper is an opportunity for review at a deeper rhythm.

\section{Case Study 1: “Going Meta” workshop at Anticipation 2022}\label{anticipation-case-study}

This workshop functioned as a more developed pilot of methods that we
already shared in earlier pilots (at PLoP 2021, at Oxford Brookes
Creative Industries Festival, and previously in more nascent forms).
Our aims were both to introduce the methods to attendees, and to
‘workshop’ the methods.  Our pitch was that we would help attendees to
establish a position of maximum leverage, exercising our “Critical
Anticipatory Capacities” using “Creativity, Innovation and New Media”
(two of the conference’s themes) to explore the future of
anticipation.

\subsection{Input patterns} \label{case1-inputs}

\emph{The workshop activities were presented to workshop attendees in
the form of “pattern cards”.  A selection of these appear in Figure
\ref{cards}; several are detailed below, along with some more-abstract
patterns which were written down after the fact, but which characterize the
process that was used on the day.  The full collection of cards shared
with participants is available
online.\footnote{\url{https://hyperreal.enterprises/open-future/}}}
\emph{New cards were handed out for each phase of the workshop (for
the itinerary, see Section \ref{first-workshop-itinerary}), and were
color-coded accordingly.}

\noindent \emph{By itself, looking at the immediate surroundings only
gives an imperfect picture of how to develop a future scenario.
Direct observations might include little to no evidence of, say,
top-level government policy which likely is a major factor in the
future.  Two further patterns work together to access more levels of
meaning:}

\input{input-patterns/meaning-map.tex}

\input{input-patterns/reinfuse-expertise.tex}

\smallskip
\noindent \emph{The core process of informal sharing, map-making and
sharing knowledge works well in small groups.  A further level of
meaning can be accessed by sharing the key findings from small
groups.}

\input{input-patterns/share-back.tex}

\smallskip
\noindent \emph{This nested process of sharing is intended to surface
the core themes that the group finds important.  In CLA terms, the
contents of the {\sc Share Back} are key inputs for the Myth layer.  A
facilitated whole-group discussion of how these core themes fit
together can yield a {\sc Meaning Map} which expresses the group’s
shared Myth.  At this point in the process, both the “zoomed out”
whole-group map, and the “zoomed in” small-group maps are likely to
contain ‘optative’ statements describing “the environment as we would
like it to be” \cite{zave1997four}, potentially also including
statements about what we wish not to have happen!  These are the seeds
of ‘scenarios’, though the details of these scenarios will only become
apparent as they are explored.  That happens in subsequent phases.
The next two patterns describe the main tool we used to scaffold the
exploration phase.}

\noindent \emph{In our workshop at Anticipation 2022, we tried
aligning the {\sc Pattern Language Components} with {\sc Functional
  Roles}, as per “Phase II” in the Workshop Itinerary which follows
(Section \ref{first-workshop-itinerary}).  However, in subsequent
workshops, we decided to separate these two dimensions more
distinctly.  Further details on roles are given in the next Case Study
(Section \ref{second-case-study}).  In “Phase IV” of the Anticipation
workshop, we carried out a Project Action Review together with
participants, following the steps detailed both in the card we handed
out at the start of that phase (lower-right of Figure \ref{cards}) and
in the itinerary.  More general uses of the PAR are detailed in
“Patterns of Patterns” \cite{patterns-of-patterns-i}.  We note that
within this workshop, its purpose was similar to the {\sc Share Back}
pattern, bringing together meanings at the group level once again.  We
had hoped that participants would come up with “next steps” that they
would like to pursue themselves, but in fact, they used the
opportunity primarily to share suggestions for us.  Details of the
feedback are available
online.\footnote{\url{https://groups.google.com/g/peeragogy/c/V-knbZkwhB0}}}

Figure \ref{anticipation-workshop} shows the workshop in process
(left) and details of the notes taken by one of the facilitators

whole-group activities.  In the ``Phase IV'' review, participants had
different responses to our request to reflect on the workshop’s
activities.  Some considered the workshop to have led to good
conversations, but doubted if the manipulatives and other structures
helped.  However, we observed that some participants had used the
manipulatives in creative ways—such as asking each other to pass
around the cards to better narrate the points they were making in the
conversation.  (This experience highlights the ‘motor’ aspect of the
{\sc Functional Roles}!)  No new design patterns were generated on the
day, but follow-up reflections on the experience did suggest some
patterns.

\subsection{Diagrammatic summary of the “PLACARD” process (now “Open Future Design”)}\label{illustrative_diagram}
The diagram in Figure \ref{alex-diagram} shows how the new patterns
like {\sc Going Meta} and {\sc Increase Participant Control} would be
synthesized by following the PLACARD method.  Our “Open Future Design”
workshop made explicit use of DPL and PAR, though in this pilot it
only touched on CLA.  However, the sensory, cognitive, and motor
dimensions of PLACARD were brought into play with the patterns {\sc
  Dérive Comix}, {\sc Meaning Map}, and {\sc Functional Roles}.

\section{Case Study 2: Public Space for Public Health}\label{second-case-study}

This workshop was commissioned by co-author Abby Tabor as part of her
research project at the University of the West of England on
“Designing urban environments for human health: from the microbiome to
the metropolis”.  The aim was to gather attendees with an interest in
the project themes and work together to envision next
steps. Elaborations of these were developed by participants, and were
organized by facilitators using a software tool based on Org Roam and
Org Roam UI.
% \footnote{Demo: \url{https://hyperreal.enterprises/bristol}}

Alongside the patterns from our Anticipation pilot, here looked for
new methods to {\sc Increase Participant Control}.  In particular, we
generated some further articulations of the {\sc Functional Roles}
that would help with this.  The roles presented come with mnemonic
symbols based on the chess set: at the workshop, participants were
provided with additional physical manipulatives, i.e., the chess
pieces that correspond to the symbols here, along with new pattern
cards similar to those in Figure \ref{cards}, featuring the
descriptions here.  As mentioned previously, in the Anticipation
pilot, the roles were aligned with the {\sc Pattern Language
  Components}.  For example, the old {\sc Kaij\=u Communicator} role
(here, renamed and adapted as the “{\sc Wrinkler}”) had final say over
the challenges implied by the ‘however’ keyword.  In still-earlier
pilots, the roles were assigned more elaborate responsibilities, and
participants would receive a brief training for the role prior to
taking it on.  For example, the {\sc Designer} role (now dropped
entirely) was briefed on a specific collection of design patterns.  As
presented in this workshop, the roles were strictly functional and
were not the focus of role play as such.  Rather, an attendee would
fill a given role momentarily within a conversation, while remaining
fully themselves.

\subsection{Input patterns}

\emph{Alongside the descriptions of the roles that were given to
participants (again with pattern cards), the reader may refer to Table
\ref{mnemonic-for-manipulatives} which explains the mnemonic meaning
of the chess pieces which accompanied each role description.  A
similar informal description of the roles was also given to
participants.}

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{llp{.5\textwidth}}
\textbf{Role} & \textbf{Manipulative(s)} & \textbf{Explanation}\\ {\sc
  Time Traveler} & {\chess ♕} & In chess, the Queen can move linearly
in any direction: forward, backward, and diagonally.  Similarly, the
{\sc Time Traveler} role ‘moves’ both backwards and forwards in time,
and also explores the conditions that appear at those points in
time.\\

{\sc  Analyst} & {\chess ♗}, {\chess ♝} & In chess, there are two Bishops, both of which move diagonally, so that both are restricted to different colored squares. Here the {\sc Analyst} role divides its attention across two different spheres: articulations within the current challenge, and articulations of this challenge relative to other challenges.  \\

{\sc Wrinkler} &  {\chess ♘} & In chess, the Knight moves in a skewed fashion: in order to go in one direction, it must also go a little bit in another direction.  The {\sc Wrinkler} role, similarly, looks at how a given strategy might go askew, due to unintended consequences or otherwise.\\

{\sc Linker} &  {\chess ♖} & In chess, the Rook moves any distance, as long as it goes in a straight line.  The {\sc Linker} role, similarly, can record a link between any two related concepts.  Since all concepts are potentially related in some fashion, the {\sc Linker} focuses on making \emph{useful} connections.\\

the notes taken by off-site facilitators were presented back to

\subsection{Intermediate artifacts}

Intermediate artifacts generated within the workshop included mindmaps
created with participants, on paper.  We used a graphical template
following the outline of the Causal Layered Analysis layers to explain
the workshop’s overall workflow, and also asked participants to use a
version of this diagram as a “grid” for note-taking within Phase I, to
encourage them to work from their observations to the core underlying
themes and issues.  Participants then clarified these core themes in a
share-back process, and in Phase II, developed them further in the
form of shared future stories, outlining paths to action.  Photos in
Figure \ref{ExampleParticipantPattern} show the movement from:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Initial sketching at the start of Phase I, beginning at the
    \emph{litany} level, within small groups (upper left), to:
  \item A collection of themes shared across groups at the end of
    Phase I, to create a {\sc Meaning Map} which, in CLA terms, is
    intended to bring everyone into a shared \emph{myth} layer (lower
    left), on to:
  \item Phase II work using {\sc Pattern Language Components}, to
    identify both general and specific possibilities for action around
    a theme.
\end{itemize}

the {\sc Pattern Language Components} and {\sc Functional Roles}.
Here, the material shared by participants is summarized and condensed
in proto-pattern form.  For an example showing how the patterns looked

\input{input-patterns/context-setting.tex}

\subsection{Further remark on the Roles of Roles}
Relevant high-level actions would revise and re-articulate the
proto-patterns above in more formal terms, alongside with a process of
evidence-gathering that would support or refute the value of specific
interventions that ramify the patterns in their local context.  These
future operations might be supported by new {\sc Functional Roles}, or
by further elaborations of those already described above, such as
through creating or combining roles.  Indeed, review (e.g., during a
PAR) of the contributions to the process that were made by different
roles could help to articulate the need and plan for evolution at the
process level.

Presently, with Table \ref{active-inference-factors} we draw attention
to the way in which the three main participant roles operationalize
key aspects of the Active Inference Framework (see
\citet{SMITH2022102632} for a primer on the key concepts in AIF).  A
synthesis of DPL and AIF would go beyond the classical neuroscientific
language that underpins PLACARD.  It would integrate something like
our {\sc Functional Roles} roles into patterns themselves, so that
given pattern would be able to ‘sense’ when it needs to be revised to
match a previously-unexpected reality; or, similarly, a collection of
patterns would sense when a new pattern needs to be created, when an
existing pattern should be applied, or when the structure and function
of the generative model needs to change in more radical ways.

\section{Case Study 3: Open Research Futures}

This workshop was developed as an “Away Day” for faculty and staff
members at Oxford Brookes University.  The aim of the workshop is to
elaborate the institution’s open research strategy relative to its
existing organizational strategy.  Methodologically, this workshop
builds on a pre-seeded Org Roam network of interlinked themes and an
additional activity that enlists attendees in taking concrete actions
on the identified next steps.  This itinerary reused the language
“experts to citizens”, “citizens to action” from the previous workshop
(with a slight variation suited to the context).  It is worth
remarking here that these phases mirror the {\sc Dérive Comix}—{\sc
  Meaning Map}—{\sc Reinfuse Expertise} structure introduced in the
first case study, and that, in CLA terms, the effect is a journey from
\emph{litany-to-myth-back-to-litany}, with the new litany taking the
form of potential actions.

\subsection{Intermediate artifacts}

Figure \ref{brookes-workshop} shows how the {\sc Pattern Language
  Components} were used in the second phase of the workshop, building
on a CLA-based discussion that developed the {\sc Meaning Map} in the
workshop’s first phase (background, right).  In this case, the
keywords and manipulatives corresponding to {\sc Functional Roles}
(cf. Table \ref{mnemonic-for-manipulatives}) were not used to spell
out entire draft patterns (as in Figure
\ref{ExampleParticipantPattern}), but rather, to generate a network of
relations.

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[trim={.2cm 0cm 0cm 2cm},clip=true,width=.4\textwidth]{fragment1.jpg}  &

\end{tabular}
\caption{The {\sc Pattern Language Components} were used organically within the workshop.\label{brookes-workshop}}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{Org-Roam-Screenshot} shows how material was then drawn
together, using Org Roam to analyze the workshop themes (per the {\sc
  Linker} pattern), further elaborating the {\sc Meaning Map}.
Contents of the paper-based diagrams, like those in Figure
\ref{brookes-workshop}, were condensed and edited in the digital
notes, rather than represented verbatim.  For example, the idea of
reintroducing a ``common room'' (Figure \ref{brookes-workshop}, left)
is folded into the ``Research Environment'' node, along with the
challenge of holding conversations when “people aren’t here” in
person.  The digital notes also provided an opportunity to further
correction and synthesis of links which hadn’t been spelled out so
directly with the manipulatives, e.g., the name ``Richard Owens''
[sic] was noted down in the workshop (Figure \ref{brookes-workshop},
right), and is represented in the digital notes as Richard Owen, key
proponent of responsible innovation \cite{Owen2013}, within the
``responsible'' node.

The overall process illustrated in Figure \ref{Org-Roam-Screenshot}
moves in the opposite direction of \emph{Figures 3-7} of
\citet{iba2016pattern} (insofar as those figures complexify a tree as
a graph).  Here, we move from an interlinked graph of topics to a
summary map in tree form, represented here by the Outline of an Open
Research Action Plan node.  This process relates to the interplay of
informal and formal work, elaborated in Appendix
\ref{synthesis-of-form}.

In brief, the organic, playful, interactions within the workshop were
useful in creating the more formal output (a draft policy document)
precisely because these interactions were informed by a suitable
metalanguage, including the apparatus of Causal Layered Analysis, the
{\sc Pattern Language Components}, the {\sc Functional Roles}, the
{\sc Meaning Map}, and other patterns described so far in the paper.
By contrast, the acronym ``SOLACE'' mentioned in the itinerary—which
aims to describe an approach to research that is grounded in
organizational values “Success, Openness, Learning by doing,
Adaptability and Creativity, and Equal opportunity”
\cite{corneli-varuf}—was primarily useful for {\sc Context Setting}.
That level of analysis only provides a “mental picture”, in the terms
of \citet{alexander1964notes}.  A hypothetical Open Research Action
Plan based on stakeholder interviews and the “SOLACE” concept, but
omitting the workshop experience, might express the university’s
values, but it would not draw on the same richness of meaning, nor the
same level of practical detail.

\subsection{Introduction the course from the instructor, Mary Tedeschi}
\input{mary-section}

\subsection{Our use of “Patterns of Patterns” within the course, by guest lecturers Raymond Puzio, Joe Corneli, and Charlie Danoff}
\label{pop1-in-cis9590}
We used the paper “Patterns of Patterns” as a focal text with three
successive cohorts of CIS 9590 students.  The course syllabus is
focused on developing group projects with a computer programming
component.  Our hope was that the topics in the paper would inspire
them with new ideas about design and collaboration.  We focus
primarily on the latest iteration of the course (Spring 2023), in
which we made the most explicit use of the methods described above.
Figure \ref{cis-9590-anticipations} shows some of our anticipations of
the relevant concerns that apply in this context.
Each semester, students asked many thoughtful \emph{questions} about the
paper; they also produced their own \emph{written response} to the
paper, engaging the original paper in depth; and in the latest run, we
offered some in-class \emph{exercises} based on the workshop methods
described above.  Reading these written responses showed that the
students had not only understood the main ideas of our paper, but
added to them.  In effect, they created alternative imaginaries for
the paper’s history and future.  For instance, in their 2022 ‘case
study’, they generated a “Recommendation and Implementation Plan”
which proposed specific actions which a group could take based on our
ideas; and, in 2023, the students produced a slide presentation based
upon our paper, exploring its relationship to themes such as “emerging
technology”.  It is worth highlighting that while our paper did touch
briefly on the theme of emerging technology, the students considerably
elevated the importance of that theme in their feedback.

\subsection{Experience report by CIS 9590 student, Kajol Khetan}\label{sec:kajol-report}

The PLACARD method emphasizes understanding the context, selecting an
appropriate language or languages for thinking about problems in that
context, and taking relevant actions to guide the development process.
In our project work, we adapted the CLA component of this framework by
identifying the layers relevant to our chosen problem, namely, to
create a website that allows users to discover nearby coffee shops
easily.  We identified the following layers for our analysis (each
with several facets, see Figure \ref{kajol-box}): User Interface,
Functionality, Data Flow, Infrastructure, and External Factors.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{mdframed}
\textbf{User Interface Layer}

\textit{Analyzed user interactions}: Implemented an interactive map
interface using JavaScript and integrated the Google Maps API.

\textit{Designed elements}: Developed a responsive and visually appealing
layout with markers representing coffee shops on the map.

\textit{User experience}: Prioritized ease of use, ensuring smooth
navigation, intuitive filtering options, and clear visual cues.

\textbf{Functionality Layer}

\textit{Core features}: Enabled users to search for coffee shops based
on location and preferences.

\textit{Functions/modules}: Implemented search functionality, marker
clustering, and information display for each coffee shop.

\textit{User feedback}: Incorporated user feedback to enhance
features, such as real-time reviews and ratings integration.

\textbf{Data Flow Layer}:
Processed user inputs: Captured user location and
preferences to provide relevant search results.

\textit{Stored data}: Utilized a database to store coffee shop
information, such as names, addresses, ratings, and reviews.

\textit{Data display}: Dynamically populated the map and details
sections with data retrieved from the database.

\textbf{Infrastructure Layer}:

\textit{Technology stack}: Utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Google
Maps API for the front end; PHP and MySQL for the back end.

\textit{Compatibility}: Ensured cross-browser compatibility and
responsive design to cater to various devices.

\textit{Server setup}: Hosted the website on a reliable server with
efficient performance.

\textbf{External Factors Layer}:

\textit{User requirements}: Considered user preferences, such as
coffee shop categories (e.g., vegan-friendly, Wi-Fi availability).

\textit{Business goals}: Aligned with the goal of promoting local
coffee shops and providing a convenient user experience.

\textit{Market trends}: Incorporated emerging trends, such as
real-time user reviews and social media sharing.

\end{mdframed}
\caption{Layers in the analysis of a coffee discovery website\label{kajol-box}}
\end{figure}

CLA guides us to look for \emph{causal relationships} operating within
and between these layers.  In particular:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Changes in the User Interface layer influenced user engagement
    and ease of interaction.
  \item Adjustments in Functionality impacted the overall user
  experience and satisfaction.
  \item Data Flow optimizations directly affected the accuracy and
    relevance of coffee shop information.
  \item Infrastructure decisions impacted website performance and
    responsiveness.
  \item External factors influenced design choices and user
    satisfaction.
\end{itemize}

Our adaptation of Causal Layered Analysis led to a comprehensive
understanding of the website's components and their interdependencies,
and facilitated a structured approach to development.  The nearby
coffee shops website was successfully developed and deployed.  Users
can input their location and receive a map display of nearby coffee
shops, along with relevant information such as ratings, reviews, and
operating hours.  Our group’s process could be condensed into an
overall protopattern:

\input{input-patterns/adapt-layers-as-needed.tex}

%% 6. Discussion:

%% The application of the CLA method facilitated a structured approach to
%% development, ensuring that project requirements were met while
%% adhering to best practices. The integration of design patterns
%% streamlined development, leading to a user-friendly and responsive
%% website.

%% 7. Lessons Learned:

%% Through the project, we learned the importance of selecting
%% appropriate design patterns based on the context and requirements. The
%% CLA method guided decision- making and enhanced project management,
%% resulting in a successful outcome. CLA highlighted the importance of
%% systematically analyzing and optimizing each layer for a cohesive and
%% effective user experience. Flexibility and adaptability were key in
%% addressing challenges and meeting user needs.


\subsection{Further proto-patterns describing the course experience, by CIS 9590 student, Manny Singh}\label{sec:manny-protopatterns}

%% Introduction:
%% During my final project class led by Professor Mary Tedeschi, the research paper 'Pattern of Patterns' and its authors played a pivotal role in shaping my project decisions. The authors' active engagement in our Zoom sessions provided invaluable insights into project layout, helped me avoid common mistakes, and encouraged a scalable and adaptable approach. Their active engagement and promises to come again in the following weeks to see progress on everyone’s individual project kept the butterflies, nervousness, and willingness to deliver all alive at the same time.

\emph{The following proto-patterns summarize one student’s reflection
on how our “active engagement and promises to come again in the
following weeks to see progress on everyone’s individual project kept
the butterflies, nervousness, and willingness to deliver all alive at
the same time.”  Further inline commentary expands and analyzes the
proto-patterns using {\sc Pattern Language Components}.}

\noindent\emph{Notice that within this capsule summary there are at least two implied conflicts:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Team work is required HOWEVER the ways to scaffold effective collaboration are not entirely obvious;}
\item \emph{Project development is required HOWEVER project structure is not obvious.}
\end{itemize}
\emph{Our interactions with both the teacher and the students helped us theorize the confusion:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{These difficulties exist BECAUSE participants do not have enough experience grappling with ‘worked examples’ (both learning best practices from successful examples, and learning by giving constructive feedback on less-successful examples).}
\end{itemize}
\emph{“Patterns of Patterns” provides some generic methods that can be applied to the domain-level problems.  Moreover, contact with the authors shifted the game, relative to simply reading the preprint.}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{THEREFORE, share some easy-to-understand general-purpose methods with novices, and put them in regular contact with people who have significant experience with problems in the domains of project management and collaboration.}
\end{itemize}
\emph{Thinking beyond the Spring 2023 CIS 9590 cohort to next steps, we need better ways to share this kind of experience:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{SPECIFICALLY, can the Peeragogy project develop an internship/mentoring programme, and how would the design of such a programme be reflected in our design pattern catalogue?  Respectively, can more touchpoints for mentoring and peer feedback be built into the CIS 9590 curriculum?}
\end{itemize}

\input{input-patterns/avoiding-mistakes.tex}

\smallskip
\noindent \emph{The nice features of “effective documentation, regular testing, and thorough project planning” might be interpreted in terms of PLACARD components:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{A project needs to be carried out HOWEVER it’s not clear what to do to make the project a success}
  \item \emph{BECAUSE projects have fairly well-known failure modes}
  \item \emph{THEREFORE teach and carry out ways to avert those
  failures: e.g., use Project Action Reviews to keep track of
  incremental steps in the development of the project; use Design
  Pattern Languages to design, build and evaluate prototypes; and use
  Causal Layered Analysis to integrate data from these to build an
  adaptable project plan that addresses a real problem.}
\end{itemize}
\emph{(That said, it would be helpful to offer more specific guidance, relevant to the novices’ working context.)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{SPECIFICALLY, use a resource like
\citet{hoover2009apprenticeship} to flesh out this advice for future
CIS 9590 cohorts, and ask them to document the patterns they use.}
\end{itemize}

\input{input-patterns/scaling-and-adaptability.tex}

\smallskip
\noindent \emph{In the language we’ve been using internally,
“scalability and adaptability” sounds a lot like ‘working across
contexts’.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{We want a system that will adapt to situations we haven’t encountered yet HOWEVER we need something reasonably specific and concrete in order to work in any given context}
  \item \emph{BECAUSE we need to organize evolving complexity}
  \item \emph{THEREFORE develop a modular approach to design and development, and incorporate future scanning into the workflow}
  \item \emph{SPECIFICALLY let’s look for more ways to develop ‘alternative imaginaries’ for the Patterns of Patterns project}.

\caption{Diagrams created before our first session with the CIS 9590 students, inspired by Causal Layered Analysis.  The diagrams describe our working context as guests in CIS 9590 (left), and our initial understanding of the students’ working context (right).\label{cis-9590-anticipations}}
\end{figure}

We conclude this section with a summary reflection on our use of
``Patterns of Patterns” within CIS 9590, using the (standard) Causal
Layered Analysis layers.  This is scaffolded by the two diagrams in
Figure \ref{cis-9590-anticipations}.

\subsubsection{Litany}
Initially our paper was introduced as a contemporary reading, relevant
to the Computer Information Systems (“CIS”) theme.  Mary chose a
contemporary paper in part because students would not be able to
“cheat” in their reports, because our paper wasn’t described
extensively on Sparknotes or similar.  Along with this (intentional)
challenge, CIS 9590 students encountered a range of more or less
predictable problems, e.g., many felt a lack of confidence with
coding.  The students came to the course with a variety of different
backgrounds (e.g., Python vs C++) which contributed to some friction
with this course.  As guest lecturers, our initial anticipations
(summarized in Figure \ref{cis-9590-anticipations}) didn’t precisely
match our reflections at the end of the course.  This suggests the
potential need for more design patterns.  With the benefit of
hindsight, next time we might elaborate on Manny Singh’s
proto-patterns to give them more specificity, and influence our
participation in future cohorts.  More broadly, we observe that when
\emph{working across contexts}, many of the ‘forces’ at work within a
given context are initially hidden to us.  For example, we didn’t
anticipate the students’ hesitance around coding, nor did we anticipate
their taking up the cause for emerging technologies around PLACARD
methods.

\subsubsection{System}
Whereas in our rounds of earlier participation we were more there for
enrichment, in the most recent semester, our contributions were more
closely integrated into the main activities of the course.  We
attended more sessions, including one in which we attempted to run a
short version of the workshop with attendees via Zoom.  Ongoing
interaction saw us in an ‘in residence’ role, advising on various
aspects of the projects.  Furthermore, Mary attended at least as many
meetings of the Peeragogy project (one of the centers of development
for PLACARD) as we attended sessions of the course, fostering an
exchange of ideas and viewpoints between these two contexts. In the
short term, this led to productive synergy and, in the long term,
could lead to our pedagogical and peeragogical initiatives becoming
more integrated into a larger system. This collaboration continued
post-semester, insofar as Mary invited the students to express
interest in possible internships in the Peeragogy project.

\subsubsection{Worldview}
Students were thinking about their future careers.  What they wanted
to get out of the course (e.g., becoming a well-paid data scientist or
business leader) at times had some friction with the practical reality
of the course requirements, in which they had to deliver a concrete
hands-on working project, without being able to rely on employees.
PLACARD wouldn’t be of much direct help with the technical challenges
they faced with the Intel One platform, but we hoped it would help
them organize their work in a sensible way.  The ideas underlying
PLACARD informed our contributions to the course at various levels;
for example, in a session with Mary in which we ‘workshopped’ CIS 9590
with other peeragogues, discussants suggested adding more touchpoints
for peer learning and feedback (\emph{\`a la} the PAR).

\subsubsection{Myth}
A deep metaphor within the classroom setting is \emph{pedagogy}.
However, the methods that we brought to the course as guests were more
linked with our experience of \emph{peeragogy}.  In the new shared
context, these two perspectives begin to integrate.  Mary as a host
exercised the value of \emph{xenia} by bringing us into her course as
guests.  The possibility of student internships within the Peeragogy
project would create the reciprocal opportunity for further student
practice with CIS skills in an applied context, helping to build tools
and platforms for peer learning and peer production (including through
use of pattern methods).  Indeed, the particular combination of peer
learning and formal education developed here led us to wonder how far
off the Peeragogy project might be from being able to support informal
learning of relevant programming concepts (preliminaries to CIS 9590)
or applied computing projects (an analogue of CIS 9590).  The
students’ emphasis on the theme of ‘emerging technology’ suggested
that whatever synthesis develops, it may include significantly
upgraded technical components.  We’ve seen a corresponding need for
emerging methods, e.g., in Kajol Khetan’s suggestion to {\sc Adapt
  Layers As Needed}.  As a whole, this case study follows the
\emph{litany-to-myth-back-to-litany} structure typical of other
workshops.  As in Case Study 1 (Section
\ref{anticipation-case-study}), we used our participant-observer role
to workshop our methods, generating new ideas to explore in our
ongoing and future work.  For example, in Figure \ref{sridevi-course},
we built on our experience with CIS 9590 to help design a future
Introduction to Computing course for high school students.  Here, part
of the \emph{system} layer envisions ‘multiple circles’ (i.e., multiple
instantiations of the four-layer CLA template) which would express the
developing perspectives of different groups of students in the course,
to be integrated into one overview through a ‘monitoring’ interface
used by the instructor.  This is a useful expression of what
\emph{working across contexts} can mean in practice, shifts the
metaphor from bridging between two contexts to developing prototype
interactions that necessarily combine several contexts.  For future
work in teaching programming, it would be interesting to integrate
programming-specific design considerations, as described, e.g., by
\citet{felleisen2018design}, with the collaborative approach to
program development described here.

%% Conclusion:
%% The research paper 'Pattern of Patterns' and its authors significantly influenced my final project experience. Their engagement, guidance in project layout, avoidance of common mistakes, and focus on scalability and adaptability empowered me to make informed decisions. By observing patterns and applying their insights, I successfully developed a project that thrived in the dynamic landscape of technology. I am grateful for the authors' contributions, which shaped my final project journey under Professor Mary Tedeschi's guidance.

\section{Discussion}

We presented the patterns that we developed and used over successive
runs of our workshop, in approximately chronological order.  This
showed how the use of certain patterns gave rise to the ``seeds'' of
new patterns.  It now makes sense to think of the evolving workshop
method as a pattern language which operationalizes the PLACARD
pattern.

The first workshop mixed {\sc Pattern Language Components} with {\sc
  Functional Roles}, putting participants in the thick of a
pattern-related dialogue.  While this led to interesting
conversations, it was more work to extract any patterns.  However, we
did find some useful process patterns this way, such as {\sc Increase
  Participant Control}.  We employed what we learned in subsequent
runs.  In the second workshop, a more distinct use of the {\sc Pattern
  Language Components} helped the participants come up with their own
patterns.

There is an interesting interplay between content-level patterns like
these, and process-level patterns.  For instance, the workshop is akin
to a public space; further development of the associated tools might
make it even more of a public resource — somewhat like Wikipedia, but endorsing the contribution of original research, not forbidding it.  Already, the workshop is a context in which to do a kind of rapid, local, open research.

In order for any pattern-informed research to work well, we should be gathering evidence for or against the salience of the patterns that are elaborated.  The Octopus\footnote{\url{https://www.octopus.ac/}} platform mentioned in the itinerary for Case Study 3 uses several data types that follow the rough outline of a scientific paper, \emph{viz.},
Research Problem,
Rationale/Hypothesis,
Method,
Results,
Analysis,
Interpretation,
Real World Application, and
Peer Review.
The formulation of an Octopus-like platform for recording and reporting on design patterns would probably need to change somewhat — but the \textbf{Problem}, \textbf{Rationale}, \textbf{Method}, and \textbf{Results} components are reasonably familiar for pattern authors.

Table \ref{summary} summarizes the patterns that were described in
this paper, pulling them together from across the separate case
studies.  The table shows the patterns grouped in a way that
elaborates our use of “PAR”, “CLA”, and “DPL” methods (summarized in
Section \ref{sec:org7c32ecc}) with a more rounded description of the
purposes that sensory, cognitive, and motor methods serve.  Figure
\ref{pattern-analysis} summarizes the patterns in a more visual way.

%% (Another nice feature we can observe in this write-up is
%% that the {\sc Reflector} and {\sc Time Traveller} work as a pair,
%% since both are primarily sensory patterns, and similarly the {\sc
%% Analyst} and {\sc Linker} work as a pair of cognitive roles.)

\section{Conclusion}

We hoped that running these workshops would help us design the next
steps for our platform and process, and this seems to have been
successful.  As an immediate outcome, we developed the “PLACARD
workshop” — now retitled “Open Future Design” — across several
successive runs in different organizational contexts in a way that
makes it more robust.  This relative success notwithstanding, it is
worth recalling that our initial intention in “Patterns of Patterns”
was to support distributed collaboration across contexts.

The informal pattern-based review of our evolving work, presented
here, is a good start, if only a partial implementation of the vision.
Running the Open Future Design workshop in different settings and
writing up our findings here implements the {\sc Do Your Research}
pattern.  Nevertheless, although wide-ranging and participatory, the
development of this research remains mostly centralized.  We have not
yet implemented a fully distributed peer-to-peer collaboration
platform, however, we have created something like a client-server
simulation of one.

A crucial insight is that the meta-level is just another domain.  All
models that aim to be practical — whether patterns of public health,
open research, climate action, or patterns of patterns — should
include predictions about the causal connections between actions and
measurements, and should incorporate strategic intelligence to
articulate action.

Again, here, we have made a start.  In particular, this research
scaffolds an alternative Causal Layered Analysis of pattern language
methods to the one developed in the previous “Patterns of Patterns”
paper.  (The visual summary in Figure \ref{pattern-analysis} is
elaborated in textual form in Appendix \ref{cla-appendix}.)  More work
would be needed to fully describe our patterns’ application domains,
to build evidence of the kinds of results that can be expected, and to
describe their interconnections as a pattern language.

That work would usefully have a software aspect.  For example, a
not-so-distant future for Org Roam would allow several facilitators to
make notes in near real-time into a shared map, and with some more
fine tuning of the Emacs interface, a similar workflow could be used
directly by workshop attendees, even across different contexts.  Many
rich dialogues might ensue: already we have seen the potential for
fruitful cross-disciplinary interaction between people from fields as
disparate as future studies, health sciences, open research, and
information systems.  Existing systems such as
Alkemio\footnote{\url{https://alkem.io/}} are being built with the
need for collaboration across organizational boundaries in mind,
preferring \emph{challenge-focused} collaboration.

An approach centered on DPLs which work \emph{across related
challenges} could take that basic approach even further.  From an
architecture perspective, a knowledge management tool like Org Roam
could be augmented with additional “emerging technologies” that make
it more useful for complex collaboration needs.  Support for the
articulation of domain-level patterns which outline potential new
behaviors, and for the process of gathering evidence that those
behaviors do (or do not) in fact work as intended is an ambitious but
logical ramification of the pattern method.  A further step is needed
to articulate the learning apparatus that underpins such mechanisms in
a computationally-coherent way.  The {\sc Functional Roles} we’ve set
forth here provide an early informal articulation of the process, and
their connections to the Active Inference Framework could scaffold
further more formal developments of the apparatus.

Active Inference is currently being explored as a new paradigm for
artificial intelligence
\cite{friston2022designing,albarracin2023designing}.  In Section
\ref{second-case-study}, we touched on how AIF could elaborate and
work with DPL models.  Whatever underlying formalism is used, AI tools
could usefully identify analogies between action arenas, highlight the
ramifications of complex actions, show predicted costs and benefits,
search for tipping points that allow the effects of change to reach
across level boundaries, and surface new questions.

We have begun (as we mean to carry on) by focusing on the development
and articulation of multi-purpose tools for thought.

\section{Relationship to Alexander’s “Synthesis of Form”\label{synthesis-of-form}}
In this paper and the previous paper on “Patterns of Patterns” we have
considered the problems faced by groups of people organizing their
activities.  This can be usefully related to two diagrams from
Alexander's ``Notes on the Synthesis of Form'', recopied below as
Figure \ref{synthesis-diagrams}.  Parts a.-c. of this figure have two
columns corresponding to context/form (or problem/solution), and one,
two, or three rows, corresponding to the ``actual world'', ``mental
picture'' and ``formal picture''.  A design problem is posed at the
level of the actual world, say, ``build a house atop this hill'' or
``make a celebration song''.

The design problem can be solved at one of the three levels.  The most
direct approach is to work in the actual world.  For instance, a
musician might pick up an instrument, start playing something, try out
different possibilities, modify notes or phrasings to make it sound
better, and so come up with a song.

At the level of ``mental picture'', a designer receives design
requirements which describe the problem, and produces a plan which
describes a solution.  For instance, the host of the party might make
a request ``Write a joyous song for alto voice accompanied by flute,
trumpet, and saxophone to celebrate the acceptance of our paper into
the conference.''  A composer might then sit down at a desk, away from
any instruments, and write out a score which would later be handed to
the singer and instrumentalists for performance.  Alexander points out
that there is a danger in this process: the composer would no longer
have the immediate feedback which comes from working directly in the
actual world.  Accordingly, the result might be a song that matches
the description, but doesn’t match the mood of the event.

Alexander’s proposed solution is to produce a formal picture of the
mental picture, and instead work with that formal picture.  For our
example, it might take the form of a suitably elaborate music theory,
one that includes concepts like ‘\emph{ballabile}’ (which indicates
that the song should be danceable).  More generally, we employ a
suitable metalanguage to reason about the mental representation; this
process of reasoning can then take the place of feedback from the
actual world in guiding and evaluating our designs.  For Alexander,
this consists of a set-theoretic formalization of design requirements
and potential misfits.

%% In the PLACARD setting, (CLA’s layers might correspond,
%% metaphorically, to the different voices used in the composition; a
%% analysis process akin to CLA might help to address goodness-of-fit.

Figure \ref{synthesis-diagrams}d refers to the process of design once
we have arrived at the ``formal picture'' level.  The left panel
represents the analytic process in which one decomposes a design
problem into subproblems and the right panel represents the
complementary synthetic process in which one successively combines
solutions to subproblems to arrive at a solution to the original
problem.  Alexander proposed a maximum entropy method for carrying out
the analysis and, in later works, introduced design patterns for use
in the synthesis; and ultimately, described 15 principles that could
guide a design at an even more abstract level.

The naive ``actual world'' approach (Figure \ref{synthesis-diagrams}a)
would be when a group takes a ``seat of the pants'' approach to
dealing with issues as they come up in the course of work.  PAR can
help to sketch a ``mental picture''.  CLA and DPL can be used as
techniques for analysis and synthesis at the ``formal picture'' level.
 Just as even a talented
musician without a solid grasp of music theory would be hard pressed
to compose an augmentation canon or symphony, so too we suggest that a
group which faces complex challenges may want to consider these
techniques for orchestrating their activities.  In sum, the methods
we’ve discussed can be used to operationalize a strategy that is at
the heart of Christopher Alexander’s oeuvre.

\section{SUPPLEMENT: Analysis: CLA applied to “Patterns of Patterns”} \label{cla-appendix}
\subsection{Litany: Understanding data, headlines, empirical world (short term change)}
Our Open Future Design workshop has evolved certain key features which
have been retained across different implementations.  Participants can
expect a certain amount of {\sc Context Setting}, as well as an
introduction to {\sc Pattern Language Components}, and {\sc Functional
  Roles}.  The outputs are created collaboratively, with some emphasis
on {\sc Facilitator Roles}.  One outstanding problem is how the
process of facilitation can be distributed out to participants, since
the PLACARD pattern which inspires Open Future Design is intended for
distributed collaboration.  Already our current ingredients have
allowed us to organize a (small-scale) pattern-based research
programme, addressing one of the problems that we saw in our earlier
CLA of the DPL literature.

We have seen that Open Future Design can help people articulate and
grapple with issues they see in their lives and communities, for
example {\sc Funding of Public Space}, {\sc Contested Space} and the
need to {\sc Rebalance Social Services}.  This list is representative
rather than exhaustive.

\subsection{System: Systemic approaches and solutions (social system)}
The workshop proceeds through a combination of process steps ({\sc
  D\'erive Comix}, {\sc Meaning Map}, {\sc Reinfuse Expertise}),
supported by facilitators who may work behind the scenes to {\sc Do
  Your Research}, or more overtly to {\sc Structure Conversations} and
{\sc Structure Outputs}.  Facilitators can also take on the roles of {\sc
  Linkers} and {\sc Reflectors}, while participants are invited to
take on the roles of {\sc Analyst}, {\sc Time Traveler}, and {\sc
  Wrinkler}.  The methods we have used have a tendancy to {\sc
  Increase Participant Control}.  This could be pushed further, e.g.,
with earlier phases that involve workshop participants in co-designing
the workshop experience itself, and in subsequent phases which gather
and analyze data.  The current articulation of patterns offers a
considerable amount of material that be folded into such developments.

\subsection{Worldview: ways of knowing and alternative discourse}
The perspective, articulated by one workshop user and endorsed by our
authoring collective, is that these methods help to communicate a
worldview which endorses {\sc Scaling and Adaptability}, which offers
{\sc Engagement and Guidance}, and which helps with {\sc Avoiding
  Mistakes}.  The Open Future Design workshop goes along with the view
that {\sc The Future Begins Now}, insofar as the actions which are
considered inside the workshop are things that are worth testing and
developing.  For this purpose a primary method used is {\sc Pilot to
  Anticipate}.  Taken together, these perspectives are linked with the
ethos of Peeragogy or “peer produced peer learning”.

\subsection{Myths: metaphors and narratives (longer term change)}
We have flagged {\sc Going Meta} as the primary metaphor of this work,
in line with the series title, “Patterns of Patterns”.  The point is
not to be ‘meta’ just for the sake of it, but to find the
commonalities that reoccur across contexts, and to build bridges
between different communities.  {\sc Going Meta} embeds a workflow
within itself, as in the example of a wheel with ball bearings; and
specifically, regarding the role that “Patterns of Patterns” play
relative to patterns themselves:
\begin{quote}
  Technological progress is achieved through a dialectical
  relationship between mediation (adaptation to the end terms: the
  path to be travelled and the load to be carried) and
  autocorrelation, the relation between the technical object and
  itself. \cite{Simondon2005-pq}
\end{quote}
{\sc Going Meta}, by applying PLACARD to itself, as it were, allows
us to \emph{reflect} on our intention, \emph{understand} where we are
in the process of development we outlined, and \emph{articulate} a way
forward.

\section{Shepherd comments 1 Jul 2023, 05:43 and response}

\begin{leftbubbles}
\label{Q:developed-by-authors} Section4: Question regarding pattern contents: In section 3, it is mentioned that "We used design patterns directly when developing and running the workshops. A selection of these patterns are included here." Are the patterns presented in section 4 the same design patterns developed by the authors, or are they created by someone else?
\end{leftbubbles}
\begin{rightbubbles}
Most of the patterns in the Case Studies were developed by the
authors, a few were developed by workshop participants during the
workshop and only summarized here ({\sc
  \hyperref[pat:contested-space]{Contested Space}}, {\sc
  \hyperref[pat:funding-of-public-space]{Funding of Public Space}},
{\sc \hyperref[{pat:rebalance-social-services}]{Rebalance Social
    Services}}).  Regarding contributions from Manvinder Singh: he was
originally a ‘participant’, and then became an author.
\end{rightbubbles}

\begin{leftbubbles}
Additionally, the format of the "Selected Patterns for Case Study" in
section 4 varies (e.g., some have only summaries or start with
questions), which raises concerns. If these patterns were developed by
the authors, it should write patterns in a consistent format with
context, problem, and solution. Furthermore, it is necessary to
include the Forces that explain the causes of the problem and the
Consequences as potential results of implementing the solution.
\end{leftbubbles}

\begin{rightbubbles}
Personally, I (Joe) don’t fully agree with the suggestion to use
‘consistent format’ throughout the document.  The patterns are
presented at different levels of formality corresponding to their
stage of development.  Personally I don’t see forces, consequences,
and potential results as entirely necessary, though they might be nice
to have.  In particular, if the patterns aren’t understable in their
current format, they certainly need to be revised.  Let’s see if the
clarifications we’ve developed so far are enough.

What we’ve come up with, after consultation with the coauthors, is a
better explanation of what we aim to do with the patterns here (in the
Methodology section) and a lot more pictures that aim to illustrate
the points that are being made.  Hopefully this achieves most of the
additional clarity that was intended by the shepherd suggestion above.

%(One more quick point about forces: we talk briefly about how a force
%analysis is complicated by working across contexts in Section
%\ref{further-reflections}.)
\end{rightbubbles}

\begin{leftbubbles}
Regarding the structure: In the current paper, each subsection of
section 4 presents the Itinerary first, then presents the “Selected
Patterns for Case Study.” However, since the patterns are embedded
within the Itinerary without being presented beforehand, it becomes
unclear. It leads to confusion, such as in the case of
4.1.2. Considering the flow from the METHODOLOGY in section 3, it
might be more reader-friendly and coherent to present 4.1.1 as
"Selected Patterns for Case Study" and 4.1.2 as Itinerary. This way,
readers can follow along with the discovery of how the patterns shape
the itinerary. Additionally, assigning pattern numbers to each pattern
and including the number in parentheses after the pattern mentioned in
the itinerary would make it more comprehensible for readers. For
example, something like "Meaning Map (No.3) in the content of
Itinerary."
\end{leftbubbles}

\begin{rightbubbles}
I’ve restructured each subsection ‘in order’ with clearly delineated
inputs, process, and outputs.  {\huge ✔️}
\end{rightbubbles}

\begin{leftbubbles}
4.1: Regarding DÉRIVE COMIX: The solution "Go for a walk or just look
out the window wherever you are, and document what you see” is
important for solving the problem. However, in the Itinerary, it is
mentioned to "Bring data: captioned mental images of “anticipation in
action” (feel free to refer to photos on your phone)," which does not
align with the solution of the pattern.
\end{leftbubbles}

\begin{rightbubbles}
Slightly reworded to make these align better. {\huge ✔️}
\end{rightbubbles}

\begin{leftbubbles}
4.5: The subsection name of "Proto-patterns describing the experience,
by a CIS 9590 student, Manvinder Singh” seems to be unrelated to the
"CASE STUDIES” which is the name of section 4. It might be better to
present this as a separate section. Furthermore, the content written
here appears to be a summary of what was learned from the case studies
rather than patterns. If it is intended to be patterns, it is
necessary to include the context, problem, and solution.
\end{leftbubbles}

\begin{rightbubbles}
The \LaTeX\ section level was incorrect, which was the main source of
confusion here.  These are “outputs” from Case Study 4 — not
reflections on all of the case studies.  That’s fixed now.  {\huge ✔️}

(As for how formal we need to be about presenting them, see my comment
above for now.)
\end{rightbubbles}

\begin{leftbubbles}
Examples: AVOIDING MISTAKES, it is necessary to describe the effective
solutions and the potential problems that may arise if those solutions
are not implemented.
\end{leftbubbles}

\begin{rightbubbles}
I’ve presented the material in both proto-pattern form and expanded
using pattern language components; I think that’s the right level of
detail for now. {\huge ✔️}
\end{rightbubbles}

\section{Shepherd comments 3 Aug 2023, 15:58 and response}

\begin{leftbubbles}
The BACKGROUND and METHODOLOGY are written more detailed than before, which makes it easier to understand what you created and how it is created.
\end{leftbubbles}

\begin{rightbubbles}
{\huge 👍}
\end{rightbubbles}

\begin{leftbubbles}
section3: The explanation of the diamond mark is written as a difference of the writing style of the patterns, but as I read the paper, I wondered if the patterns with diamonds are also new patterns. If the pattern shown with the diamonds mark was created by the workshop, that should be included as a supplemental explanation.
\end{leftbubbles}

\begin{rightbubbles}
I introduced the separate {\huge ⚒} marker to distinguish those
patterns which were created by workshop participants.  Since we are
not presenting the exactly as they appeared in the workshop, they
could be presented in either pattern or proto-pattern form.  For now,
I’ve chosen to present them as proto-patterns, so the three patterns
that are concerned also have the {\huge 💎} marker (see page 14). {\huge ✔️}
\end{rightbubbles}

\begin{leftbubbles}
Section4:DÉRIVE COMIX: It says "If you have a group BUT everyone has their own experiences" as the problem, but why is everyone has their own experiences a problem?  Is it a problem that each person has different experiences, so their thoughts about the future are diverse, and it is difficult for the group to agree on a single scenario for the future?, or is it a problem that it is difficult to understand each other's future scenarios?
\end{leftbubbles}

\begin{rightbubbles}
The diversity of perspectives in the group is really a good thing, since it can contribute to a richer meaning map!  As such this is an opportunity.  In the revised description of {\sc Pattern Language Components} for some wordsmithing related to how the “problem” language of DPL can be confusing for participants!  In {\sc D\'erive Comix}, the problem is really that “the group has been identified BUT the members don’t know each other well yet, and accordingly each has their own separate experience, and the group has no concrete shared meanings”... so I’ve included that revised text! {\huge ✔️}
\end{rightbubbles}


\begin{leftbubbles}
MEANING MAP (c): What is the problem with "everyone has their own experience"?
\end{leftbubbles}

\begin{rightbubbles}
Again, this is mostly an opportunity: and the wording needs to be
clarified, and I’ve tried to do so! {\huge ✔️}
\end{rightbubbles}

\begin{leftbubbles}
REINFUSE EXPERTISE: What is the problem with “If everyone has experience as a citizen BUT they also have expertise”?  Is it a problem that because we have a specialized area of expertise, they can only come up with opinions that are limited by that expertise, and the variety of ideas becomes narrower?
\end{leftbubbles}

\begin{rightbubbles}
That’s certainly one part of the problem.  If people just share
information with other experts, the discussion can become “siloed”.
The problem is how to overcome this tendency.  The idea in {\sc
  Reinfuse Expertise} is to overcome it by bringing together with
people who have different expertise, getting them onto the same page
as citizens, and only \emph{then} turning to their expertise.  I’ve
tried to revise the pattern to clarify this. {\huge ✔️}
\end{rightbubbles}

\begin{leftbubbles}
PATTERN LANGUAGE COMPONENTS: What is the meaning of “Dynamic
keywords”? I cannot get that However or BECAUSE is written as Dynamic
keywords.
\end{leftbubbles}

\begin{rightbubbles}
What’s important is that the keywords are \emph{neutral}, rather than
dynamic.  Indeed, I’ve forgotten what ‘dynamic’ was supposed to mean!
So, I’ve tried to clarify what’s going on in the pattern text.
Basically, if we start with a ‘problem’ (as in standard DPL language),
then people often object that they don’t want to focus on problems,
but rather on challenges, or even better, on solutions!  However, DPL
does have ‘conflicting forces’ at the core: so we need to a way for
people to talk about conflict, without getting frustrated.  That’s
what this pattern is trying to do. {\huge ✔️}
\end{rightbubbles}

\begin{leftbubbles}
Figure 1 makes it easy to understand the pattern at a glance and it is
good that you included pictures related to the patterns in the figure
1. However, I feel that there is a disconnect between the pictures and
the content of the pattern. It would be better to make the pictures
more consistent with the content of the pattern. And the “Projection
Action Review” came out suddenly, and I wondered where it came from. I
also wonder why this pattern is only in different color, and why
PATTERN LANGUAGE COMPONENTS and FUNCTIONAL ROLES aren’t included in
the Figure 1.
\end{leftbubbles}

\begin{rightbubbles}
The aim of Figure 1 is primarily documentary, so I would only want to
narrate it differently — rather than change the contents.  I’ve added
some clarifying comments about that figure (e.g., explaining why a
different color was used, and also explaining that some of the
patterns used here are after-the-fact descriptions of what we did on
the day).  I provided a link to the full set of cards shared with
participants in a footnote. {\huge ✔️}
\end{rightbubbles}

\begin{leftbubbles}
I really like the diagram in Figure 2 that shows the relationships
between sensory, cognitive, and motor patterns. It would be better to
describe this in the sentence and refer to Figure 2.
\end{leftbubbles}

\begin{rightbubbles}
We modified the picture slightly so that it is a bit simpler, and made
the accompanying text more to the point. {\huge ✔️}
\end{rightbubbles}

\begin{leftbubbles}
section5: I didn't catch who Abby Tabor was for a moment, so it would be more helpful to the reader to include a word like "the auther" or "professor", which would identify someone.
\end{leftbubbles}

\begin{rightbubbles}
Added ``coauthor” to explain her role in the paper. {\huge ✔️}
\end{rightbubbles}

\begin{leftbubbles}
I could not see why the patterns are presented based on the chess set
so it would be helpful to have a more detailed explanation about the
reationships between pattern and chess set.
\end{leftbubbles}

\begin{rightbubbles}
I added a new Table \ref{mnemonic-for-manipulatives} which explains
the relationship to the chess pieces.  Although it wasn’t specifically
requested in your shepherding remarks, I’d also like to point to Table
\ref{active-inference-factors}, which re-describes the main roles in
more theoretically-salient terms. {\huge ✔️}
\end{rightbubbles}

\begin{leftbubbles}
Figure 3 came out suddenly, but which sentence is it referred to in? It is good to have many figures in the paper, but it is better to explain what they are about in the sentences. Figures are to supplement the sentences written in the body of the paper, so if there are no sentences that refer to the figure, the figure will not be valid.
\end{leftbubbles}

\begin{rightbubbles}
  I’ve checked in Emacs, using \texttt{occur}, that the figures and
  tables are all referenced in nearby text.  The text should now be
  readable in a stand-alone fashion (i.e., without the
  figures). {\huge ✔️}
\end{rightbubbles}
