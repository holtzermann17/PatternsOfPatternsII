\subsection*{REINFUSE EXPERTISE {\hfill \motor}}

\textbf{Context} a group wants to build a {\sc Meaning Map}.\newline
\textbf{If} everyone has experience as human being (and resident,
citizen, etc.) BUT they also have some experience as an expert which
is harder to share with non-experts;\newline \textbf{Then} begin by
removing expertise to get everyone on the same page, and subsequently
reinfuse expertise, to enable richer and more complex thinking.
