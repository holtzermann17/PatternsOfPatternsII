\subsection*{\normalsize{\emoji{pick}\emoji{gem}} FUNDING OF PUBLIC SPACE{\hfill \cognitive}}\label{pat:funding-of-public-space}

Even though public space is known to increase wellness in the
population, well-being priorities that would lead to increased funding
for public space arenâ€™t universally adopted.  In order to make the
benefits of such investment clear, increase transparency around
investments in public welfare, e.g., create a register of impacts of
local social enterprises.
