%\textbf{Context}:
The project's context was to provide users with a simple, intuitive
platform for locating nearby coffee shops. Challenges inherent to this
problem included real-time data updates and dynamic user interactions.
We needed to select appropriate design and implementation
\emph{languages}, and plan and carry out suitable \emph{actions}.
%\newline \textbf{Languages}:
The project employed Python, SQL, and Google Maps API. Layer-based
analysis facilitates effective communication among team members,
enabling seamless collaboration, and aides both design and
implementation.
%\newline \textbf{Actions}:
Design patterns such
as {\scitshape MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture}, the
{\scitshape Observer} pattern for real-time updates, and the
{\scitshape Singleton} pattern for managing map instances were
integrated into the development process.
