\subsection*{FACILITATOR ROLES {\hfill \cognitive}}
\textbf{Context} Developing a collection of interrelated design
patterns.\newline \textbf{If} you are getting ideas from participants
who play {\sc Functional Roles} BUT the ideas arenâ€™t all connected
with each other in a structured way.\newline \textbf{Then} introduce
facilitator roles to help structure the collection.\newline
\textbf{Specifically}, {\sc Linker}s, and {\sc Reflector}s are two
roles that we have found useful.
