\subsection*{DO YOUR RESEARCH{\hfill\sensory}}
\textbf{Context} Prior to beginning a formal workshop or other participatory research activity.\newline
\textbf{If} it looks like it will be possible to do participatory research BUT the participants havenâ€™t begun speaking with each other yet.\newline \textbf{Then}
start doing the research in a more centralised way before inviting direct collaboration, in order to give participants something to engage with.\newline
\textbf{Example} In the current setting, this pre-research included 1-to-1 interviews with about half of the invitees, as well as internet research to find and explore related scenarios developed by others.\footnote{\url{https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/research-culture/changing-expectations/visions-of-2035/visions-of-2035-materials/}}
