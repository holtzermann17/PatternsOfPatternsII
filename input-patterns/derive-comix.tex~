\textbf{Context} you want to develop some future scenarios to explore with a group.\newline
\textbf{If} you have an group BUT everyone has their own experiences;\newline
\textbf{Then} Gather data.  For example: go for a walk \cite{debord},  or just look out the window wherever you are.  (Alternatively, close your eyes and conduct a mental exploration of your selected theme: what do you see in “your mind’s eye?”) Document what you see.  Follow up by preparing your materials to share in a succinct fashion, e.g., as photos, a screenshot, slides, sketches, a zine, a map, or some PostIt\textsuperscript{\textregistered} notes.
