\subsection*{STRUCTURE CONVERSATIONS{\hfill\cognitive}}
\textbf{Context} Having convened a workshop or other participatory research activity.\newline
\textbf{If} unstructured discussions are likely to take lots of time but without yielding concrete benefits.\newline \textbf{Then}
structure the discussions around shared interests to move things forward more effectively.\newline
\textbf{Example} At this workshop, we decided to group participants around tables according to the faculty where they were employed (or most closely aligned, in the case of university-level support staff).
