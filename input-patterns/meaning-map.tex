\subsection*{MEANING MAP {\hfill\cognitive}}

\textbf{Context} We have collected images describing people’s worlds
(see {\sc Dérive Comics}).\newline \textbf{If} you want to distill
well-integrated shared understandings for the group BUT, so far,
everyone has been keeping their experience, knowledge, and
perspectives to themselves;\newline \textbf{Then} talk together about
the problems and opportunities that everyone sees in the data that has
been shared, and document any connections you find.  Maybe some of the
themes will cluster together.  Maybe everyone will have wildly
different perspectives: that’s OK.  You can use these different
viewpoints to bring everyone on the same page: just document them as
part of the map.
