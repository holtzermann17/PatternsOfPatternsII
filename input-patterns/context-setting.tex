\subsection*{CONTEXT SETTING {\hfill \cognitive}}
\textbf{Context} A workshop or other working context has been
convened.\newline \textbf{If} the facilitators have ideas that they
would like to explore with attendees BUT these ideas are not top of
mind for attendees.\newline \textbf{Then} do some context-setting,
e.g., showing videos, giving a short talk about why people have been
invited and describe the hoped-for outcomes.
