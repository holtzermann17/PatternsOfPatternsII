\subsection*{PATTERN LANGUAGE COMPONENTS {\hfill \cognitive}}

\textbf{Context} In a collaborative setting with people who are new to
design patterns.\newline \textbf{If} attendees are being invited to
create new design patterns that operationalize knowledge at the group
level BUT the typical framing language of DPLs — which have ‘conflict’
at the core — is not comfortable for participants (e.g., because a
‘problem’ or ‘conflict’ is seen as a bad thing)\newline \textbf{Then}
introduce and describe neutral keywords such as \emph{HOWEVER} (which
can variously be used to describe a gap, a conflict, an opportunity,
or even a simple juxtaposition of facts), \emph{BECAUSE} (to describe
a set of operating causes), \emph{THEREFORE} (to describe a rationale
based on related data) , and \emph{SPECIFICALLY} (to describe next
steps), to help people build patterns piece by piece.
