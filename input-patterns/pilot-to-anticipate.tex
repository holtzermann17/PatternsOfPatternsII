\subsection*{\normalsize{\emoji{gem}} PILOT TO ANTICIPATE {\hfill \sensory}}

Invoking the {\sc Going Meta} pattern, we reflect that our strategy of
\emph{piloting our workshop methods} was how we choose to anticipate
the issues likely to arise in future iterations of the workshop.
Perhaps the future of anticipation more widely will include the
increased use of pilot schemes?  In support of this possibility, \citet{unger2019imagination} have advocated for the enthusiastic embrace of “Experimental government”.
