\subsection*{MEANING MAP {\hfill\cognitive}}

\textbf{Context} We have collected images describing people’s worlds
(see {\sc Dérive Comics}).\newline \textbf{If} you want to distill
shared meaning BUT everyone has their own experience;\newline
\textbf{Then} talk together about the problems and opportunities that
everyone sees.  Maybe some of these will cluster together, or maybe
everyone will have their own different perspective: that’s OK.  You
can use these different viewpoints to get everyone on the same
page.\newline\smallskip
