\textbf{Context} In the course of working on a project
together.\newline \textbf{If} we find a \textit{gap} between our
ideals and our methods;\newline \textbf{Then} Try “going meta”, to
explore how the project’s methods can be applied to itself.\newline
\textbf{Example} In a community that usually focuses on anticipating
the future for others, try inviting members of the community to
anticipate the future of the community.
