\subsection*{SHARE BACK {\hfill\cognitive}}

\textbf{Context} Sub-groups have shared their experiences and each has
developed a {\sc Meaning Map} \newline \textbf{If} we want to
establish a meaning map for the whole group BUT unstructured
interaction within the whole room is infeasible;\newline \textbf{Then}
ask individual groups to share present key findings to the room; or,
alternatively, if the conversations are not yet at a natural stopping
point ask the groups to pause their conversations and listen briefly
to the one of groups (in turn) which will continue their small-group
conversation.\newline\smallskip
