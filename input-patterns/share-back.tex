\subsection*{SHARE BACK {\hfill\sensory}}

\textbf{Context} Members of sub-groups have shared their experiences with each other, and each sub-group has
developed a {\sc Meaning Map} \newline \textbf{If} we want to
establish a meaning map for the whole group BUT unstructured
interaction within the whole room is infeasible;\newline \textbf{Then}
individual groups should present key findings to the room; or,
alternatively, if the conversations are not yet at a natural stopping
point ask the groups to pause their conversations and listen in briefly
to the one of groups (in turn), who will continue their small-group
conversation.
