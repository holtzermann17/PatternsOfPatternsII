\subsection*{PATTERN LANGUAGE COMPONENTS {\hfill \sensory}}

\textbf{Context} In a collaborative setting with people who are new to
design patterns.\newline \textbf{If} new attendees are being invited
to create new patterns BUT the context, problem, solution language
brings assumptions that they may not be comfortable \newline \textbf{Then}
introduce more dynamic keywords such as HOWEVER (to describe a gap or
conflict), BECAUSE (to describe a set of operating causes), THEREFORE
(to describe a rationale based on related data) , and SPECIFICALLY (to
describe next steps), to help people build patterns piece by piece.
